## Part 3: Important Translation Issues

### Singular and plural **you**

In this book, the word **I** refers to Paul. Also, the word **you** is almost always singular and refers to Titus. The exception to this is 3:15. (See: \[\[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive\]\] and \[\[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you\]\])

### What is the meaning of **God our Savior**?

This is a common phrase in this letter. Paul meant to make the readers think about how God forgave them in Christ for sinning against him, and by forgiving them he saved them from being punished when he judges all people. A similar phrase in this letter is **our great God and Savior Jesus Christ**.' or . = '# Introduction to Titus
