LUK	front	intro	uk55			0		# Introduction to the Gospel of Luke<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Luke<br><br>1. Introduction and purpose for writing (1:1-4)<br>1. Birth of Jesus and his preparation for his ministry (1:5-4:13)<br>1. Jesus’ ministry in Galilee (4:14-9:50)<br>1. Jesus’ journey to Jerusalem<br>- Discipleship (9:51-11:13)<br>- Conflict and Jesus’ grief (11:14-14:35)<br>- Parables about things that are lost and found. Parables about honesty and dishonesty (15:1-16:31)<br>- Kingdom of God (17:1-19:27)<br>- Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem (19:28–-44)<br>1. Jesus in Jerusalem (19:45-21:4)<br>1. Jesus’ teaching about his second coming (21:5–-36)<br>1. Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection (22:1–-24:53)<br><br>### What is the Gospel of Luke about?<br><br>The Gospel of Luke is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the gospels wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Luke wrote his gospel for a person named Theophilus. Luke wrote an accurate description of the life of Jesus so that Theophilus would be certain of what is true. However, Luke expected the gospel to encourage all believers, not just Theophilus.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Luke” or “The Gospel according to Luke.” Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, for example, “The Good News about Jesus that Luke wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Luke?<br><br>This book does not give the name of the author. The same person who wrote this book also wrote the Book of Acts. In parts of the Book of Acts, the author uses the word “we.” This indicates that the author traveled with Paul. Most scholars think that Luke was this person traveling with Paul. Therefore, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought Luke was the author of both the Book of Luke and the Book of Acts.<br><br>Luke was a medical doctor. His way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile. Luke himself probably did not witness what Jesus said and did. But he said that he talked to many people who did.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What are the roles of women in the Gospel of Luke?<br><br>Luke described women in a very positive way in his gospel. For example, he often showed women being more faithful to God than most men. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])<br><br>### Why does Luke write so much about the final week of Jesus’ life?<br><br>Luke wrote much about Jesus’ final week. He wanted his readers to think deeply about Jesus’ final week and his death on the cross. He wanted people to understand that Jesus willingly died on the cross so that God could forgive them for sinning against him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What are the Synoptic Gospels?<br><br>The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”<br><br>The texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.<br><br>### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?<br><br>In the gospels, Jesus called himself the “Son of Man.” It is a reference to Daniel 7:13-14. In this passage there is a person described as a “son of man.” That means the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to the son of man to rule over the nations forever. And all the people will worship him forever.<br><br>Jews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. Therefore, Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])<br><br>Translating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Luke?<br><br>The following verses are not in the earliest manuscripts. The ULT and UST include these verses, but some other versions do not.<br><br>* “Then an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.” (22:43–44)<br>* “Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” (23:34)<br><br>The following verse is not included in many modern versions. Some versions put it into square brackets. Translators are advised not to translate this verse. However, if in the translators’ region, there are older versions of the Bible that include this verse, the translators can include it. If they are translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it was probably not original to Luke’s Gospel.<br><br>* “For he was required to release one prisoner during the feast” (23:17)<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	1	intro	f1b5			0		# Luke 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 1:46-55, 68-79.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “He will be called John”<br><br>Most people in the ancient Near East would give a child the same name as someone in their families. People were surprised that Elizabeth and Zechariah named their son John because there was no one else in their family with that name.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>Luke’s language is simple and straightforward. He does not use many figures of speech.

LUK	3	intro	tkg5			0		# Luke 03 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 3:4-6, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Justice<br>John’s instructions to the soldiers and tax collectors in this chapter are not complicated. They are things that should have been obvious to them. He instructed them to live justly. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [Luke 3:12-15](./12.md))<br><br>### Genealogy<br>A genealogy is a list which records a person’s ancestors or descendants. Such lists were very important in determining who had the right be king, because the king’s authority was usually passed down or inherited from his father. It was also common for other important people to have a recorded genealogy.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Prophecy often involves the use of metaphors to express its meaning. Spiritual discernment is needed for proper interpretation of the prophecy. The prophecy of Isaiah is an extended metaphor describing the ministry of John the Baptist ([Luke 3:4-6](./04.md)). Translation is difficult. It is suggested that the translator treat each line of the ULT as a separate metaphor. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “(Herod) had John locked up in prison”<br>This event can cause confusion because the author says John was imprisoned and then says he was baptizing Jesus. The author probably uses this phrase in anticipation of Herod’s imprisonment of John. This would mean that this statement is still in the future at the time of the narrative.

LUK	5	intro	axr7			0		# Luke 05 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “You will catch men”<br><br>Peter, James, and John were fishermen. When Jesus told them that they would catch men, he was using a metaphor to tell them he wanted them to help people believe the good news about him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### Sinners<br><br>When the people of Jesus’ time spoke of “sinners,” they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses and instead committed sins like stealing or sexual sins. When Jesus said that he came to call “sinners,” he meant that only people who believe that they are sinners can be his followers. This is true even if they are not what most people think of as “sinners.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### Fasting and Feasting<br><br>People would fast, or not eat food for a long time, when they were sad or were showing God that they were sorry for their sins. When they were happy, like during weddings, they would have feasts, or meals where they would eat much food. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fast]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Hypothetical Situation<br><br>Jesus uses a hypothetical situation to condemn the Pharisees. This passage includes “people in good health” and “righteous people.” This does not mean that there are people who do not need Jesus. There are no “righteous people,” everybody needs Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]] and [Luke 5:31-32](./31.md))<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Implicit information<br><br>In several parts of this chapter the author left some information implicit that his original readers would have understood and thought about. Modern readers might not know some of those things, so they might have trouble understanding all that the author was communicating. The UST often shows how that information can be presented so that modern readers will be able to understand those passages. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Past Events<br><br>Parts of this chapter are sequences of events that have already happened. In a given passage, Luke sometimes writes as if the events have already happened while other events are still in progress (even though they are complete at the time he writes). This can cause difficulty in translation by creating an illogical order of events. It may be necessary to make these consistent by writing as if all the events have already happened.<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Luke 5:24](../../luk/05/24.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

LUK	5	23	ysw3	figs-ellipsis	εὐκοπώτερον, εἰπεῖν	1	easier to say	The unspoken implication is that one thing is “easier to say because no one will know what has happened,” but the other thing is “harder to say because everyone will know what has happened.” People could not see if the man’s sins were forgiven, but they would all know he was healed if he got up and walked.

LUK	6	intro	vv2y			0		# Luke 06 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Luke 6:20-49 contains many blessings and woes that appear to correspond to Matthew 5-7. This part of Matthew has traditionally been called the “Sermon on the Mount.” In Luke, they are not as connected to a teaching on the kingdom of God as they are in Matthew’s gospel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Eating the grain”<br><br>When the disciples plucked and ate the grain in a field they were walking through on the Sabbath ([Luke 6:1](../../luk/06/01.md)), the Pharisees said that they were breaking the law of Moses. The Pharisees said that the disciples were doing work by picking the grain and so disobeying God’s command to rest and not work on the Sabbath.<br><br>The Pharisees did not think the disciples were stealing. That is because the law of Moses required farmers to allow travelers to pluck and eat small amounts of grain from plants in fields they traveled through or near. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Metaphors are pictures of visible objects that speakers use to explain invisible truths. Jesus used a metaphor of a generous grain merchant to teach his people to be generous ([Luke 6:38](../../luk/06/38.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>Rhetorical questions are questions to which the speaker already knows the answer. The Pharisees scolded Jesus by asking him a rhetorical question when they thought he was breaking the Sabbath ([Luke 6:2](../../luk/06/02.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Implicit information<br><br>Speakers usually do not say things that they think their hearers already understand. When Luke wrote that the disciples were rubbing the heads of grain between their hands, he expected his reader to know that they were separating the part they would eat from what they would throw away ([Luke 6:1](../../luk/06/01.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### The twelve disciples<br><br>The following are the lists of the twelve disciples:<br><br>In Matthew:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Mark:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Luke:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>Thaddaeus is probably the same person as Jude, the son of James.

Jesus asks this question to force the Pharisees to admit that he was right to heal on the Sabbath. The intent of the question is thus rhetorical: to get them to admit what they all know is true rather than to obtain information. However, Jesus says, “I ask you,” so this question is not like other rhetorical questions that might need to be translated as statements. This should be translated as a question. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

LUK	7	intro	u8gj			0		# Luke 07 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted material in 7:27.<br><br>Several times in this chapter Luke changes his topic without marking the change. You should not try to make these rough changes smooth.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Centurion<br><br>The centurion who asked Jesus to heal his slave ([Luke 7:2](../../luk/07/02.md)) was doing many unusual things. A Roman soldier would almost never go to a Jew for anything, and most wealthy people did not love or care for their slaves. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/centurion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### John’s Baptism<br><br>John baptized people to show that those he was baptizing knew they were sinners and were sorry for their sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### “Sinners”<br><br>Luke refers to a group of people as “sinners.” The Jewish leaders considered these people to be hopelessly ignorant of the law of Moses, and so called them “sinners.” In reality, the leaders were sinful. This situation can be taken as irony. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>### “Feet”<br><br>The feet of the people in the ancient Near East were very dirty because they wore sandals and the roads and trails were dusty and muddy. Only slaves washed other people’s feet. The woman who washed Jesus’ feet was showing him great honor.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Luke 7:34](../../luk/07/34.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

LUK	9	intro	uc1r			0		# Luke 09 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “To preach the kingdom of God”<br><br>No one knows for sure what the words “kingdom of God” here refer to. Some say it refers to the reign of God on earth, and others say it refers to the gospel message that Jesus died to pay for the his people’s sins. It is best to translate this as “to preach about the kingdom of God” or “to teach them about how God was going to show himself as king.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### Elijah<br><br>God had promised the Jews that the prophet Elijah would return before the Messiah came, so some people who saw Jesus do miracles thought Jesus was Elijah ([Luke 9:9](../../luk/09/09.md), [Luke 9:19](../../luk/09/19.md)). However, Elijah did come to earth to speak with Jesus ([Luke 9:30](../../luk/09/30.md)). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/elijah]])<br><br>### “Kingdom of God”<br><br>The term “kingdom of God” is used in this chapter to refer to a kingdom that was still in the future when the words were spoken. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])<br><br>### Glory<br><br>Scripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. Luke says in this chapter that Jesus’ clothing shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God’s Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. An example in this chapter is: “Whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.” ([Luke 9:24](../../luk/09/24.md)).<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Luke 9:22](../../luk/09/22.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])<br><br>### “Receiving”<br><br>This word appears several times in this chapter and means different things. When Jesus says, “If someone receives a little child like this in my name, he also is receiving me, and if someone receives me, he is also receiving the one who sent me” ([Luke 9:48](../../luk/09/48.md)), he is speaking of people serving the child. When Luke says, “the people there did not receive him” ([Luke 9:53](../../luk/09/53.md)), he means that the people did not believe in or accept Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])

Instead, the expression **the dead** likely refers figuratively to those who do not follow Jesus and so are spiritually dead. Alternate translation: “Let people who are not concerned about spiritual things take care of everyday matters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	60	1006	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς νεκροὺς	1	the dead	This expression refers to dead people in general. Alternate translation: “people who are dead” or “people who are not concerned about spiritual things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

LUK	9	62	1010	figs-metaphor	οὐδεὶς…εὔθετός ἐστιν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	no one…is fit for the kingdom of God	Jesus responds with an illustration that is designed to teach this person about what is required to be his disciple. He means that a person is not suitable for the kingdom to God if his past loyalties remain primary, above loyalty to Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain this illustration. Alternate translation, add: “No one can plow straight if they are looking backwards. In the same way, no one will be useful in the kingdom of God if their past loyalties remain primary” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	62	1011	figs-synecdoche	οὐδεὶς ἐπιβαλὼν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἄροτρον	1	No one, having put his hand on a plow	Jesus refers figuratively to a person using a plow by describing one part of that activity, guiding the plow with the hand.

LUK	9	62	1012	translate-unknown	οὐδεὶς ἐπιβαλὼν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἄροτρον	1	No one, having put his hand on a plow	A “plow” is a tool that farmers use to break up soil to prepare a field for planting. Plows have sharp, pointed prongs that dig into the soil. They usually have handles that the farmer uses to guide the plow. If your readers would not be familiar with this kind of tool, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “no one who needs to go straight forward” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	9	62	1013	figs-explicit	βλέπων εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω	1	looking back	The implication is that anyone who is looking backwards while plowing cannot guide the plow where it needs to go. That person must focus on looking forward in order to plow well. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “looking back, and so not going in the right direction” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	62	1014		εὔθετός ἐστιν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	is fit for the kingdom of God	Alternate translation: “will be useful in the kingdom of God” or “is suitable for the kingdom of God”
LUK	10	intro	z899			0		# Luke 10 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Harvest<br><br>Harvest is when people go out to get the food they have planted so they can bring it to their houses and eat it.

(See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### Neighbor<br><br>A neighbor is anyone who lives nearby. The Jews helped their Jewish neighbors who needed help, and they expected their Jewish neighbors to help them. Jesus wanted them to understand that people who were not Jews were also their neighbors, so he told them a parable ([Luke 10:29-36](./29.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

LUK	11	intro	j6le			0		# Luke 11 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The ULT sets the lines in 11:2-4 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are a special prayer.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The Lord’s Prayer<br><br>When Jesus’ followers asked him to teach them how to pray, he taught them this prayer. He did not expect them to use the same words every time they prayed, but he did want them to know what God wanted them to pray about.<br><br>### Jonah<br><br>Jonah was an Old Testament prophet who was sent to the Gentile city of Nineveh to tell them to repent. When he told them to repent, they repented. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])<br><br>### Light and darkness<br><br>The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### Washing<br><br>The Pharisees would wash themselves and the things they ate with. They would even wash things that were not dirty. The law of Moses did not tell them to wash these things, but they would wash them anyway. This was because they thought that if they obeyed both the rules that God had made and some rules that God had not made, God would think that they were better people. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])

LUK	12	intro	jun3			0		# Luke 12 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Blasphemy against the Spirit”<br><br>No one knows for sure what actions people perform or what words they say when they commit this sin. However, they probably insult the Holy Spirit and his work. Part of the Holy Spirit’s work is to make people understand that they are sinners and that they need to have God forgive them. Therefore, anyone who does not try to stop sinning is probably committing blasphemy against the Spirit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>### Servants<br><br>God expects his people to remember that everything in the world belongs to God. God gives his people things so they can serve him. He wants them to please him by doing what he wants them to do with everything he has given them. One day Jesus will ask his servants what they have done with everything he gave them to use. He will give a reward to those who have done what he wanted them to do, and he will punish those who have not.<br><br>### Division<br><br>Jesus knew that those who did not choose to follow him would hate those who did choose to follow him. He also knew that most people love their families more than they love anyone else. So he wanted his followers to understand that following and pleasing him had to be more important to them than having their family love them ([Luke 12:51-56](./51.md)).<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Luke 12;8](./08.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

The phrase “ears to hear” here is a metonym for the willingness to understand and obey. See how you translated this phrase in [Luke 8:8](../08/08.md).

LUK	15	intro	p1ba			0		# Luke 15 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>### The parable of the prodigal son<br><br>[Luke 15:11-32](./11.md) is the parable of the prodigal son. Most people think that the father in the story represented God (the Father), the sinful younger son represented those who repent and come to faith in Jesus, and the self-righteous older son represented the Pharisees. In the story the older son became angry at the father because the father forgave the younger son’s sins, and he would not go into the party the father had because the younger son repented. This was because Jesus knew that the Pharisees wanted God to think only they were good and to not forgive other people’s sins. He was teaching them that they would never be part of God’s kingdom because they thought that way. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/forgive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sinners<br><br>When the people of Jesus’ time spoke of “sinners,” they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses and instead committed sins like stealing or sexual sins. But Jesus told three parables ([Luke 15:4-7](./04.md), [Luke 15:8-10](./08.md), and [Luke 15:11-32](./11.md)) to teach that the people who believe they are sinners and who repent are the people who truly please God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

LUK	17	intro	c4am			0		# Luke 17 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Old Testament Examples<br><br>Jesus used the lives of Noah and of Lot to teach his followers. Noah was ready for the flood when it came, and they needed to be ready for him to return, because he would not warn them when he came. Lot’s wife loved the evil city she had been living in so much that God also punished her when he destroyed it, and they needed to love Jesus more than anything else,<br><br>Those who read your translation may need help so they can understand what Jesus was teaching here.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Hypothetical situations<br><br>Hypothetical situations are situations that have not actually happened. Jesus used a special type of hypothetical situation to teach that what will happen to those who cause others to sin will be worse than being drowned ([Luke 19:1-2](./01.md)) and another to scold the disciples because they had little faith ([Luke 19:6](../../luk/19/06.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>Jesus asked his disciples three questions ([Luke 17:7-9](./07.md)) to teach them that even those who serve him well are righteous only because of his grace. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Luke 17:22](../../luk/17/22.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. A paradox occurs in this chapter: “Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will save it” ([Luke 17:33](../../luk/17/33.md)).

LUK	19	intro	zn2b			0		# Luke 19 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>After Jesus helped a man named Zacchaeus repent of his sins ([Luke 19:1-10](./01.md)), he taught his followers that when he began to rule as king they would need to tell them what they had done with the things he had given them to take care of ([Luke 19:11-27](./11.md)). He did this by telling them a parable. After that, he rode into Jerusalem on a colt ([Luke 19:28-48](./28.md)). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Sinner”<br>The Pharisees refer to a group of people as “sinners.” The Jewish leaders thought these people were sinful, but in reality the leaders were also sinful. This can be taken as irony. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>### Servants<br><br>God expects his people to remember that everything in the world belongs to God. God gives his people things so they can serve him. He wants them to please him by doing what he wants them to do with everything he has given them. One day Jesus will ask his servants what they have done with everything he gave them to use. He will give a reward to those who have done what he wanted them to do, and he will punish those who have not.<br><br>### The donkey and the colt<br><br>Jesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on a donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that there were both a donkey had a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1-7](../../mat/21/01.md) and [Mark 11:1-7](../../mrk/11/01.md) and [Luke 19:29-36](../../luk/19/29.md) and [John 12:14-15](../../jhn/12/14.md))<br><br>### Spreading garments and branches<br><br>When king would enter the cities they ruled, people would cut branches from trees and take off the clothes that they wore to stay warm in cold weather and spread them all on the road so the king would ride over them. They did this to honor the king and show that they loved him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/honor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])<br><br>### The merchants in the temple<br><br>Jesus forced the people who were selling animals in the temple to leave. He did this to show everyone that he had authority over the temple and that only those who were righteous, who did what God said was good, could be in it. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

The ULT does this with the poetry in 20:17, 42-43, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Using questions to trap people<br><br>When Jesus asked the Pharisees who gave John the authority to baptize ([Luke 20:4](../../luk/20/04.md)), they could not answer because any answer they gave would give someone a reason to say that they were wrong ([Luke 20:5-6](./05.md)). They thought that they would be able to say that Jesus was wrong when they asked him if people should pay taxes to Caesar ([Luke 20:22](../../luk/20/22.md)), but Jesus gave them an answer that they had not thought of.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. In this chapter, Jesus quotes a psalm that records David calling his son “lord,” that is, “master.” However, to the Jews, ancestors were greater than their descendants. In this passage, Jesus is trying to lead his hearers to the true understanding that the Messiah will himself be divine, and that he himself is the Messiah. ([Luke 20:41-44](./41.md)).

He asks the question so the Jewish leaders will have to tell what they think to all who are listening. This question is rhetorical, but you will probably have to translate it as a question. Alternate translation: “do you think John’s authority to baptize people came from heaven or from men” or “was it God who told John to baptize people, or did people tell him to do it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

LUK	20	8	d3bg		οὐδὲ ἐγὼ λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Neither will I tell you	“And I will not tell you.” Jesus knew they were not willing to tell him the answer, so he responded in the same manner. Alternate translation: “Just as you will not tell me, I will not tell you”

LUK	20	22	fi6p		ἔξεστιν…ἢ οὔ?	1	Is it lawful…or not?

LUK	20	33	avu1		ἐν τῇ…ἀναστάσει	1	In the resurrection	“When people are raised from the dead” or “When dead people will become alive again.” Some languages have a way of showing that the Sadducees did not believe that there would be a resurrection, such as “In the supposed resurrection” or “When dead people are supposedly raised from the dead.”

At this time, Jesus told them that what they were eating and drinking were his body and his blood. Nearly all Christian churches celebrate “the Lord’s Supper,” the “Eucharist”, or “Holy Communion” to remember this meal.<br><br>### The new covenant<br><br>Some people think that Jesus established the new covenant during the supper. Others think he established it after he went up to heaven. Others think it will not be established until Jesus comes again. Your translation should say no more about this than the ULT does. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Luke 22:22](../../luk/22/22.md)).

Though this is a rhetorical question and Jesus is not asking for information, you should translate it as a question unless only a statement would cause the disciples to reply that they had lacked nothing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	22	35	a5jt	figs-you	ὅτε ἀπέστειλα ὑμᾶς	1	When I sent you out	Jesus was talking to his apostles. So languages that have different forms of “you” should use the plural form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

LUK	22	49	gv81	figs-explicit	εἰ πατάξομεν ἐν μαχαίρῃ?	1	should we strike with the sword?	The question is about the type of fight they should engage in (a sword fight), not what weapon they should use (the swords that they brought, [Luke 22:38](../22/38.md)), but your translation may need to speak of the weapons they brought. Alternate translation: “fight against them with the swords we brought” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	22	68	l7nz	figs-hypo	ἐὰν…ἐρωτήσω, οὐ μὴ ἀποκριθῆτε	1	if I ask you, you will certainly not answer	This is the second hypothetical statement. It was a way for Jesus to rebuke them without giving them a reason to convict him. These words, along with “If I tell you, you will not believe” (verse 67), show that Jesus did not believe that the council was really looking for the truth. Your language may have a way of indicating that the action has not actually happened. Jesus is saying that whether he speaks or asks them to speak, they will not respond correctly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

LUK	23	intro	p6wq			0		# Luke 23 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The ULT sets the last line of this chapter apart because it is more connected with chapter 24 than with chapter 23.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Accuse<br><br>The chief priests and scribes accused Jesus of doing evil because they wanted Pilate to kill Jesus. But they were accusing him falsely, because Jesus had never done what they accused him of doing.<br><br>### “The curtain of the temple was split in two”<br><br>The curtain in the temple was an important symbol that showed that people needed to have someone speak to God for them. They could not speak to God directly because all people are sinful and God hates sin. God split the curtain to show that Jesus’ people can now speak to God directly because Jesus has paid for their sins.<br><br>### The tomb<br><br>The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Luke 23:53](../../luk/23/53.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “I find no fault in this man”<br><br>Pilate was saying that he did not know of any reason why he should punish Jesus because Jesus had not broken any laws. Pilate was not saying that Jesus was perfect.

LUK	24	intro	r5qx			0		# Luke 24 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The tomb<br><br>The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Luke 24:1](../../luk/24/01.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>### The faith of the women<br><br>Most of Luke’s original readers would have thought of women as less important than men, but Luke carefully shows that some women loved Jesus very much and had more faith than the twelve disciples had.<br><br>### Resurrection<br><br>Luke wants his readers to understand that Jesus came alive again in a physical body ([Luke 24:38-43](./38.md)).<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Luke 24:7](../../luk/24/07.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])<br><br>### “On the third day”<br><br>Jesus told his followers that he would become alive again “on the third day” ([Luke 18:33](../../luk/18/33.md)). He died on a Friday afternoon (before sunset) and became alive again on a Sunday, so he became alive again “on the third day” because the Jews said that the day began and ended at sunset, and they counted any part of the day as a day. Friday was the first day, Saturday was the second day, and Sunday was the third day.<br><br>### Two men in bright shining robes<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels were in human form. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../../jhn/20/12.md))

LUK	24	15	b3sl		αὐτὸς Ἰησοῦς	1	Jesus himself	The word “himself” emphasizes the fact that the very Jesus they were talking about actually appeared to them. So far the women had seen the angels, but no one had seen Jesus.

This is probably an exaggeration to show that they needed to speak with him for a long time before they could change his mind.

Alternate translation: “they were able to persuade him to stay” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
