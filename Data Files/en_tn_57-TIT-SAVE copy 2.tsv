Scholars disagree about the meaning of these teachings. Further study on these issues may be necessary before translating this book.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Singular and plural **you**<br><br>In this book, the word **I** refers to Paul. Also, the word **you** is almost always singular and refers to Titus. The exception to this is 3:15. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>### What is the meaning of **God our Savior**?<br><br>This is a common phrase in this letter. Paul meant to make the readers think about how God forgave them in Christ for sinning against him, and by forgiving them he saved them from being punished when he judges all people. A similar phrase in this letter is **our great God and Savior Jesus Christ**.

TIT	2	2	xyz3	figs-ellipsis	πρεσβύτας…εἶναι	1	Older men are to be	The Greek does not have **are**, but only **older men to be**. We need to supply a verb here, drawing from the idea of **speak** in the previous verse, such as **teach** or **exhort**. Alternate translation: “Teach older men to be” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
TIT	2	2	xy13	figs-doublet	νηφαλίους…σεμνούς, σώφρονας	1	temperate, dignified, sensible	These three words are very close in meaning and may be combined into one or two terms if the target language does not have three separate terms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

TIT	2	3	gl8e	figs-ellipsis	πρεσβύτιδας ὡσαύτως	1	Older women likewise are to be	The Greek does not have **are to be**, but only **older women likewise**.

In 2:7, Paul states the meaning negatively: **uncorrupted**, meaning, **without error**, and in 2:8 he states the meaning positively: **sound, whole**, meaning **correct**. Both terms refer to Titus’s teaching. Use either positive or negative terms in the target language, or use one term with this meaning in both places if it is difficult to use two terms.
TIT	2	8	xt6v	figs-hypo	ἵνα ὁ ἐξ ἐναντίας ἐντραπῇ	1	so that the opponent may be ashamed	This presents a hypothetical situation in which someone opposes Titus and then becomes ashamed for having done so.
