Righteousness by faith in Jesus Christ (1:16-17)<br>1. All mankind is condemned because of sin (1:18-3:20)<br>1. Righteousness through Jesus Christ by faith in him (3:21-4:25)<br>1. The fruits of the Spirit (5:1-11)<br>1. Adam and Christ compared (5:12-21)<br>1. Becoming like Christ in this life (6:1-8:39)<br>1. God’s plan for Israel (9:1-11:36)<br>1. Practical advice for living as Christians (12:1-15:13)<br>1. Conclusion and greetings (15:14-16:27)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Romans?<br><br>The Apostle Paul wrote the Book of Romans. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>Paul probably wrote this letter while he was staying in the city of Corinth during his third trip through the Roman Empire.<br><br>### What is the Book of Romans about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to the Christians in Rome. Paul wanted to get them ready to receive him when he visited them. He said his purpose was to “bring about the obedience of faith” (16:26).<br><br>In this letter Paul most fully described the gospel of Jesus Christ. He explained that both Jews and non-Jews have sinned, and God will forgive them and declare them righteous only if they believe in Jesus (chapters 1-11). Then he gave them practical advice for how believers should live (chapters 12-16),<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Romans.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Rome,” or “A Letter to the Christians in Rome.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What are the titles used to refer to Jesus?<br><br>In Romans, Paul described Jesus Christ by many titles and descriptions: Jesus Christ (1:1), the Seed of David (1:3), the Son of God (1:4), the Lord Jesus Christ (1:7), Christ Jesus (3:24), Propitiation (3:25), Jesus (3:26), Jesus our Lord (4:24), Lord of Hosts (9:29), a Stumbling Stone and Rock of Offence (9:33), the End of the Law (10:4), the Deliverer (11:26), Lord of the Dead and the Living (14:9), and the Root of Jesse (15:12).<br><br>### How should theological terms in Romans be translated?<br><br>Paul uses many theological terms that are not used in the four gospels. As early Christians learned more about the meaning of Jesus Christ and his message, they needed words and expressions for new ideas. Some examples of these words are “justification” (5:1), “works of the law” (3:20), “reconcile” (5:10), “propitiation” (3:25), “sanctification” (6:19), and “the old man” (6:6).<br><br>The “key terms” dictionary can help translators understand many of these terms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])<br><br>Terms such as those given above are difficult to explain. It is often hard or impossible for translators to find equivalent terms in their own languages. It can help to know that word equivalents of these terms are not necessary. Instead, translators can develop short expressions to communicate these ideas. For example, the term “gospel” can be translated as “the good news about Jesus Christ.”<br><br>Translators should also remember that some of these terms have more than one meaning. The meaning will depend on how the author is using the word in that particular passage. For example, “righteousness” sometimes means that a person obeys God’s law. At other times, “righteousness” means that Jesus Christ has perfectly obeyed God’s law for us.<br><br>### What did Paul mean by “a remnant” of Israel (11:5)?<br><br>The idea of a “remnant” is important both in the Old Testament and for Paul. Most of the Israelites were either killed or scattered among other people when the Assyrians and then the Babylonians conquered their land. Only a relatively few Jews survived. They were known as “the remnant.”<br><br>In 11:1-9, Paul speaks of another remnant. This remnant is the Jews whom God saved because they believed in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/remnant]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What did Paul mean by being “in Christ”?<br><br>The phrase “in Christ” and similar phrases occur in 3:24; 6:11, 23; 8:1,2,39; 9:1; 12:5,17; 15:17; and 16:3,7,9,10. Paul used these kinds of phrases as a metaphor to express that Christian believers belong to Jesus Christ. Belonging to Christ means the believer is saved and is made a friend with God. The believer is also promised to live with God forever. However, this idea can be difficult to represent in many languages.<br><br>These phrases also have specific meanings that depend on how Paul used them in a particular passage. For example, in 3:24 (“the redemption that is in Christ Jesus”), Paul referred to our being redeemed “because” of Jesus Christ. In 8:9 (“you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit”), Paul spoke of believers submitting “to” the Holy Spirit. In 9:1 (“I tell the truth in Christ”), Paul meant that he is telling the truth that “is in agreement with” Jesus Christ.<br><br>Nevertheless, the basic idea of our being united with Jesus Christ (and with the Holy Spirit) is seen in these passages as well. Therefore, the translator has a choice in many passages that use “in.” He will often decide to represent the more immediate sense of “in,” such as, “by means of,” “in the manner of,” or “in regard to.” But, if possible, the translator should choose a word or phrase that reprents the immediate sense and the sense of “in union with.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inchrist]])<br><br>### How are the ideas of “holy,” “saints” or “holy ones,” and “sanctify” represented in Romans in the ULT?<br><br>The scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:<br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God considers Christians to be sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact is that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless and faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses “holy,” “holy God,” “holy ones” or “holy people.” (See: 1:7)<br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In cases where some other English versions have “saints” or “holy ones,” the ULT uses “believers.” (See: 8:27; 12:13; 15:25, 26, 31; 16:2, 15)<br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “set apart,” “dedicated to,” “consecrated,” or “reserved for.” (See: 15:16)<br><br>The UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Romans?<br><br>For the following verses, modern version of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT includes the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote.<br><br>* “he [God] works all things together for good” (8:28). Some older versions read, “All things work together for good.”<br>* “But if it is by grace, it is no longer by works. Otherwise grace would no longer be grace” (11:6). Some older versions read: “But if it is by works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.”<br><br>The following verse is not in the best ancient copies of the Bible. Translators are advised not to include this verse. However, if in the translators’ region there are older Bible versions that have this verse, the translators can include it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of Romans.<br><br>* “May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen” (16:24).<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
ROM	1	intro	hn5n			0		# Romans 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The first verse is a type of introduction. People in the ancient Mediterranean region often started their letters this way. Sometimes this is called a “salutation.”<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The gospel<br>This chapter refers to the contents of the Book of Romans as “the gospel” ([Romans 1:2](../../rom/01/02.md)). Romans is not a gospel like Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Instead, chapters 1-8 present the biblical gospel: All have sinned. Jesus died for our sins. He was raised again that we might have new life in him.<br><br>### Fruit<br>This chapter uses the imagery of fruit. The image of fruit usually refers to a person’s faith producing good works in their life. In this chapter, it refers to the results of Paul’s work among the Roman Christians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### Universal Condemnation and the Wrath of God<br>This chapter explains that everyone is without excuse. We all know about the true God, Yahweh, from his creation all around us. Because of our sin and our sinful nature, every person justly deserves the wrath of God. This wrath was satisfied by Jesus dying on a cross for those who believe in him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### “God gave them over”<br>Many scholars view the phrases “God gave them over” and “God gave them up” as theologically significant. For this reason, it is important to translate these phrases with God playing a passive role in the action. God simply allows men to pursue their own desires, he does not force them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Difficult phrases and concepts<br><br>This chapter has many difficult ideas in it. How Paul writes makes many of the phrases in this chapter difficult to translate. The translator may need to use the UST to understand the meaning of the phrases. And it may be necessary to more freely translate these phrases. Some of the difficult phrases include: “obedience of faith,” “whom I serve in my spirit,” “from faith to faith” and “exchanged the glory of the imperishable God for the likenesses of an image of perishable man.”

ROM	2	intro	dse2			0		# Romans 02 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter shifts its audience from Roman Christians to those who “judge” other people and do not believe in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])<br><br>### “Therefore you are without excuse”<br>This phrase looks back at Chapter 1. In some ways, it actually concludes what Chapter 1 teaches. This phrase explains why everyone in the world must worship the true God.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Doers of the Law”<br>Those who try to obey the law will not be justified by trying to obey it. Those who are justified by believing in Jesus show that their faith is real by obeying God’s commands. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br>Paul uses several rhetorical questions in this chapter. It appears the intent of these rhetorical questions is to make the reader see their sin so they will trust in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/guilt]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### Hypothetical Situation<br>In context, “he will give eternal life” in verse 7 is a hypothetical statement. If a person could live a perfect life, they would earn eternal life as a reward. But only Jesus was able to live a perfect life.<br><br>Paul gives another hypothetical situation in verses 17-29. Here he explains that even those who earnestly try to obey the law of Moses are guilty of violating the law. In English, this is about those who follow the “letter” of the law but cannot follow the “spirit” or general principles of the law. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “You who judge”<br>At times, this could be translated in a simpler way. But it is translated in this relatively awkward way because when Paul refers to “people who judge” he is also saying that everyone judges. It is possible to translate this as “those who judge (and everyone judges).”

ROM	4	intro	f9jc			0		# Romans 04 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 7-8 of this chapter, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The purpose of the law of Moses<br>Paul builds upon material from chapter 3. He explains how Abraham, the father of Israel, was justified. Even Abraham could not be justified by what he did. Obeying the law of Moses does not make a person right with God. Obeying God’s commands is a way a person shows they believe in God. People have always been justified only by faith. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### Circumcision<br>Circumcision was important to the Israelites. It identified a person as a descendant of Abraham. It was also a sign of the covenant between Abraham and Yahweh. However, no person was justified only by being circumcised. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br>Paul uses rhetorical questions in this chapter. It appears the intent of these rhetorical questions is to make the reader see their sin so they will trust in Jesus.

ROM	5	intro	i1dt			0		# Romans 05 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Many scholars view verses 12-17 as some of the most important, but difficult, verses in Scripture to understand. Some of their richness and meaning has likely been lost while being translated from how the original Greek was constructed.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Results of justification<br>How Paul explains the results of our being justified is an important part of this chapter. These results include having peace with God, having access to God, being confident about our future, being able to rejoice when suffering, being eternally saved, and being reconciled with God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]])<br><br>### “All sinned”<br>Scholars are divided over what Paul meant in verse 12: “And death spread to all people, because all sinned.” Some believe that all of mankind was present in the “seed of Adam.” So, as Adam is the father of all mankind, all of mankind was present when Adam sinned. Others believe that Adam served as a representative head for mankind. So when he sinned, all of mankind “fell” as a result. Whether people today played an active or passive role in Adam’s original sin is one way these views differ. Other passages will help one decide. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/seed]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])<br><br>### The second Adam<br>Adam was the first man and the first “son” of God. He was created by God. He brought sin and death into the world by eating the forbidden fruit. Paul describes Jesus as the “second Adam” in this chapter and the true son of God. He brings life and overcame sin and death by dying on the cross. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofgod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])

ROM	6	intro	v522			0		# Romans 06 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Paul begins this chapter by answering how someone might hypothetically object to what he taught in Chapter 5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Against the Law<br>In this chapter, Paul refutes the teaching that Christians can live however they want after they are saved. Scholars call this “antinomianism” or being “against the law.” To motivate godly living, Paul recalls the great price Jesus paid for a Christian to be saved. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])<br><br>### Servants of sin<br>Before believing in Jesus, sin enslaves people. God frees Christians from serving sin. They are able to choose to serve Christ in their lives. Paul explains that when Christians choose to sin, they willingly choose to sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### Fruit<br>This chapter uses the imagery of fruit. The image of fruit usually refers to a person’s faith producing good works in their life. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br>Paul uses rhetorical questions in this chapter. It appears the intent of these rhetorical questions is to make the reader see their sin so they will trust in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/guilt]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Death<br>Paul uses “death” many different ways in this chapter: physical death, spiritual death, sin reigning in the heart of man, and to end something. He contrasts sin and death with the new life provided by Christ and the new way Christians are supposed to live after they are saved. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])

ROM	8	intro	ev4r			0		# Romans 08 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The first verse of this chapter is a transitional sentence. Paul concludes his teaching of Chapter 7 and leads into the words of Chapter 8.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verse 36. Paul quotes these words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Indwelling of the Spirit<br>The Holy Spirit is said to live inside a person or inside their heart. If the Spirit is present, this signifies that a person is saved. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br><br>### “These are sons of God”<br>Jesus is the Son of God in a unique way. God also adopts Christians to be his children. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofgod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/adoption]])<br><br>### Predestination<br>Many scholars believe Paul in this chapter teaches on a subject known as “predestination.” This is related to the biblical concept of “predestine.” Some take this to indicate that God has, from before the foundation of the world, chosen some to be eternally saved. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject. So translators need to take extra care when translating this chapter, especially with regards to elements of causation. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br>Paul poetically presents his teaching in verses 38 and 39 in the form of an extended metaphor. He explains that nothing can separate a person from the love of God in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### No condemnation<br>This phrase must be translated carefully to avoid doctrinal confusion. People are still guilty of their sin. God disapproves of acting sinfully, even after believing in Jesus. God still punishes the sins of believers, but Jesus has paid the punishment for their sin. This is what Paul expresses here. The word “condemn” has several possible meanings. Here Paul emphasizes that people who believe in Jesus are no longer punished eternally for their sin by being “condemned to hell.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/guilt]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/condemn]])<br><br>### Flesh<br><br>This is a complex issue. “Flesh” is possibly a metaphor for our sinful nature. Paul is not teaching that our physical bodies are sinful. Paul appears to be teaching that as long as Christians are alive (“in the flesh”), we will continue to sin. But our new nature will be fighting against our old nature. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])

ROM	9	intro	w6f4			0		# Romans 09 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>In this chapter, Paul changes what he is teaching about. In Chapters 9-11, he focuses on the nation of Israel.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 25-29 and 33 of this chapter. Paul quotes all of these words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Flesh<br>Paul uses the word “flesh” in this chapter only to refer to Israelites, people physically descending from Abraham through Jacob, who God named Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])<br><br>In other chapters, Paul uses the word “brother” to mean fellow Christians. However, in this chapter, he uses “my brothers” to mean his kinsmen the Israelites.<br><br>Paul refers to those who believe in Jesus as “children of God” and “children of the promise.”<br><br>### Predestination<br>Many scholars believe Paul in this chapter teaches extensively on a subject known as “predestination.” This is related to the biblical concept of “predestine.” Some take this to indicate that God has, from before the foundation of the world, chosen some people to eternally save. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject. So translators need to take extra care when translating this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br><br>### Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Stone of stumbling<br>Paul explains that while some Gentiles accepted Jesus as their savior by believing in him, most Jews were trying to earn their salvation and so rejected Jesus. Paul, quoting the Old Testament, describes Jesus as a stone that the Jews stumble over when walking. This “stone of stumbling” causes them to “fall.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “It is not everyone in Israel who truly belongs to Israel”<br>Paul uses the word “Israel” in this verse with two different meanings. The first “Israel” means the physical descendants of Abraham through Jacob. The second “Israel” means those who are God’s people through faith. The UST reflects this.

ROM	11	intro	e9qz			0		# Romans 11 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 9-10, 26-27, and 34-35, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Grafting<br>Paul uses the image of “grafting” to refer to the place of the Gentiles and Jews in the plans of God. Making one plant to be permanently part of another plant is called “grafting.” Paul uses the picture of God grafting the Gentiles as a wild branch into his saving plans. But God has not forgotten about the Jews, who are spoken of as the natural plant. God will also save Jews who believe in Jesus.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Did God reject his people? May it never be”<br><br>Whether Israel (the physical descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob) has a future in the plans of God, or if they have been replaced in the plans of God by the church, is a major theological issue in Chapters 9-11. This phrase is an important part of this section of Romans. It seems to indicate that Israel remains distinct from the church. Not all scholars arrive at this conclusion. Despite their currently rejecting Jesus as their Messiah, Israel has not exhausted the grace and mercy of God.

(See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Ungodly rulers<br>When Paul teaches about obeying rulers, some readers will find this difficult to understand, especially in places where rulers persecute the church. Christians must obey their rulers as well as obey God, unless the rulers do not allow Christians to do something God explicitly commands them to do. There are times when a believer must submit to these rulers and suffer at their hands. Christians understand that this world is temporary and they will ultimately be with God forever. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Flesh<br><br>This is a complex issue. “Flesh” is possibly a metaphor for our sinful nature. Paul is not teaching that our physical bodies are sinful. Paul appears to be teaching that as long as Christians are alive (“in the flesh”), we will continue to sin. But our new nature will be fighting against our old nature. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
