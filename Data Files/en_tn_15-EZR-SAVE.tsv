EZR	front	intro	fa5r			0		# Introduction to Ezra<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of Ezra<br><br>1. The first Jewish exiles return to Jerusalem from Persia (1:1–2:70)<br>1. The people rebuild and dedicate the temple in Jerusalem (3:1–6:22)<br>1. More exiles return; Ezra teaches the Law of Yahweh (7:1-8:36)<br>1. The problem of the people marrying foreigners, and how it is solved (9:1–10:44)<br><br>### What is the Book of Ezra about?<br><br>The Book of Ezra is about how the people of Israel returned from Babylon and tried to worship Yahweh again as the law required. To do this they needed to rebuild their temple so they could sacrifice to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/temple]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>The Book of Ezra is named for the priest Ezra who led the first group of Jews out of exile and back to Judah. Translators can use the traditional title “Ezra.” Or they might choose a clearer title, such as “The Book about Ezra.”<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Why were Israelites not allowed to marry people from other nations?<br><br>Foreigners worshiped many false gods. Yahweh did not allow his people to marry foreigners. He knew this would cause the people of Israel to worship false gods. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])<br><br>### Did all of the people of Israel return to their homeland?<br><br>Many of the Jews remained in Babylon instead of returning to the Promised Land. Many of them were successful in Babylon and desired to remain there. However, this meant that they were unable to worship Yahweh in Jerusalem as their ancestors had done. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How does the Book of Ezra use the term “Israel”?<br><br>The Book of Ezra uses the term “Israel” to refer to the kingdom of Judah. It was mostly made up of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The other ten tribes had ended their loyalty to any kings descended from David. God allowed the Assyrians to conquer the other ten tribes and take them into exile. As a result, they mixed with other people groups and did not return to the land of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])<br><br>### Are the events in the Book of Ezra told in the order that they actually happened?<br><br>Some of the events in the Book of Ezra are not told in the order they actually happened. Translators should pay attention to notes that signal when events are probably out of order.
EZR	1	intro	dd25			0		# Ezra 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The chapter records the story of the first Jews as they return from Persia to Judea.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### King Cyrus<br>King Cyrus allowed them to return because he wanted them to rebuild the temple. Those who stayed behind gave gifts to those who left to help them on their journey and resettlement. This practice was common under the reign of Cyrus and was used as a way to maintain peace throughout his kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/temple]])<br><br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br>### Jews<br>Upon return to Judea, the focus of the rest of the Old Testament is on the Jewish people.
EZR	1	1	3th4	figs-explicit	 וּ⁠בִ⁠שְׁנַ֣ת אַחַ֗ת לְ⁠כ֨וֹרֶשׁ֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ פָּרַ֔ס	1		The original Jewish readers of this book would have known that this is not a reference to the year when Cyrus first became king of the Persians. Rather, it is a reference to the later year when, by conquering Babylon, he became king over the Jews, since Babylon had previously conquered them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “During the first year after Cyrus, the king of Persia, conquered Babylon and became the ruler of the Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	1	1	qvp1		 וּ⁠בִ⁠שְׁנַ֣ת אַחַ֗ת לְ⁠כ֨וֹרֶשׁ֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ פָּרַ֔ס	1		This expression could mean that sometime during the first year that he ruled over the Jews, Cyrus issued the decree that this verse describes. However, it could also mean that he issued this decree as soon as he became their ruler. Alternate translation: “As soon as Cyrus, the king of Persia, conquered Babylon and became the ruler of the Jews”
EZR	1	1	p6b4	translate-ordinal	וּ⁠בִ⁠שְׁנַ֣ת אַחַ֗ת	1	In the first year	The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, “one,” but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, “first,” in similar contexts elsewhere. If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of years, you can do that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “in the first year.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EZR	1	1	1ns6	translate-names	לְ⁠כ֨וֹרֶשׁ֙	1		This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	1	1	xkd5	translate-names	פָּרַ֔ס	1		This is the name of an empire. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	1	1	t5sz	figs-metonymy	דְּבַר־יְהוָ֖ה	1		Here “word” refers to the thing that Yahweh spoke about. Alternate translation: “the promise that Yahweh had made” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	1	1	savk	figs-metonymy	דְּבַר־יְהוָ֖ה	1		What Yahweh had said specifically was that after seventy years in exile, the Jews would be allowed to return to their homeland. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the promise that Yahweh had made that after seventy years in exile, the Jews would be allowed to return to their homeland” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	1	1	l953	translate-names	יְהוָ֖ה	1	Yahweh	This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. It occurs many times in the book, and it will be helpful to your readers if you translate it consistently each time.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]].)
EZR	1	1	y7r9	figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פִּ֣י יִרְמְיָ֑ה	1	by the mouth of Jeremiah	Here “mouth” represents speaking. Alternate translation: “which Jeremiah spoke about” or “Jeremiah announced this promise” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	1	1	fn3a	figs-synecdoche	הֵעִ֣יר יְהוָ֗ה אֶת־ר֨וּחַ֙ כֹּ֣רֶשׁ	1	Yahweh stirred the spirit of Cyrus	Here the book uses one part of Cyrus, his spirit, to represent all of him. Alternate translation: “Yahweh made Cyrus want to act” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EZR	1	1	4z5n	figs-metaphor	הֵעִ֣יר יְהוָ֗ה אֶת־ר֨וּחַ֙ כֹּ֣רֶשׁ	1		Here the book speaks figuratively of Yahweh causing Cyrus to act by saying that he “stirred up” his spirit, the way winds might stir up calm waters and make them move around. The meaning is that Yahweh directly influenced the heart and will of Cyrus to get him to do something. Alternate translation: “Yahweh made Cyrus want to act” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	1	1	n59e	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יַּֽעֲבֶר	1		This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	1	1	yiq4	figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּֽעֲבֶר־קוֹל֙ בְּ⁠כָל־מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ	1	his voice went out throughout all his kingdom	“He” means Cyrus. In this context, the “sound” is a voice speaking a message, and the voice figuratively represents the message that it speaks. But since the message could not travel by itself, ultimately the reference is to the messengers who delivered it. Alternate translation: “Cyrus sent messengers out to proclaim a decree everywhere in his empire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	1	1	x1wz	figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠גַם־בְּ⁠מִכְתָּ֖ב	1	what was written was spoken	Here the book leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. The meaning is, “Cyrus also put this decree in writing.” You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Cyrus also sent out written copies of the decree” or “Cyrus also had his scribes write down the decree in his official records” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	1	2	arwl	figs-informremind	יְהוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י הַ⁠שָּׁמָ֑יִם	1		Here Cyrus provides some background information to inform his subjects who Yahweh is. Alternate translation: “Yahweh, the God who is above all” or “Yahweh, the God who rules in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EZR	1	2	aqj5	figs-hyperbole	כֹּ֚ל מַמְלְכ֣וֹת הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	all the kingdoms of the earth	“All” is an exaggeration for emphasis. There were still some kingdoms on earth that Cyrus did not rule. However, he had conquered every other large empire in his part of the world that might have been a threat to him. Alternate translation: “has made me the unchallenged ruler over this entire land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
EZR	1	2	zb3e	figs-idioms	נָ֣תַן לִ֔⁠י	1		This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “has made me the ruler over” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	1	2	1cb6		לִ⁠בְנֽוֹת־ל֣⁠וֹ בַ֔יִת	1		Cyrus is not going to do the building personally. Rather, he means that he is giving the Jews, the people who worship Yahweh, permission and support to rebuild his temple, which the Babylonians had destroyed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to make it possible for the Jews, the people who worship him, to rebuild his temple”
EZR	1	2	3apm	figs-metaphor	בַ֔יִת	1		“House” figuratively means a temple. Cyrus speaks of this temple as if it would be a house in which God lived, since God’s presence would be there. Alternate translation: “a temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	1	2	i909	figs-informremind	בִּ⁠ירוּשָׁלִַ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר בִּֽ⁠יהוּדָֽה׃	1		Here Cyrus provides some background information about the city where he wants the Jews to rebuild the temple of Yahweh, since many of the recipients of his message might not have known where Jerusalem was. Alternate translation: “in Jerusalem, the capital city of the province of Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EZR	1	2	gmx4	translate-names	בִּ⁠ירוּשָׁלִַ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר בִּֽ⁠יהוּדָֽה׃	1	for him a house…in Judah	Jerusalem is the name of a city, and Judah is the name of the province in which it was located. These names occur many times in the book, and it will be helpful to your readers if you translate them consistently each time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	1	3	xf34	figs-explicit	מִֽי־בָ⁠כֶ֣ם מִ⁠כָּל־עַמּ֗⁠וֹ 	1	his people	“All” could possibly indicate that this decree envisions not only the people whom the Babylonians had taken into exile from the southern kingdom of Judah some decades before, and their descendants, but also any of the people whose ancestors the Assyrians had taken into exile from the northern kingdom of Israel nearly two centuries earlier. Cyrus now ruled over the territories to which both groups had been exiled. If any in the second group still had awareness and proof of their identity, and if they still wanted to honor and worship Yahweh, they could also return to Jerusalem and help rebuild the temple. (However, as verse [5] (../01/05.md) indicates, it was essentially Israelites from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin who actually did return.) Alternate translation: “Whoever is an Israelite, from any tribe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	1	3	1q6g	figs-idiom	יְהִ֤י אֱלֹהָי⁠ו֙ עִמּ֔⁠וֹ וְ⁠יַ֕עַל	1		Cyrus wishing that God will be “with” these Israelites is an idiom that expresses his wish that God would make their journey and the rebuilding project successful. Alternate translation: “May his God make him successful as he goes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	1	3	hz9g	figs-idiom	וְ⁠יַ֕עַל לִ⁠ירוּשָׁלִַ֖ם	1		Cyrus says “go up” because the Jews would have to travel from a river valley up into the mountains in order to return from their places of exile to Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “let him return to Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	1	3	k839	figs-informremind	לִ⁠ירוּשָׁלִַ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֣ר בִּ⁠יהוּדָ֑ה	1		Cyrus once again provides background information about the city. Alternate translation: “Jerusalem, in the province of Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EZR	1	3	9xbj	figs-metaphor	בֵּ֤ית יְהוָה֙	1		“House” figuratively means a temple. Cyrus continues to speak of this temple as if it would be a house in which Yahweh lived, since Yahweh’s presence would be there. Alternate translation: “a temple for Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	1	3	o6x4	figs-informremind	יְהוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל ה֥וּא הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר בִּ⁠ירוּשָׁלִָֽם׃	1		Here Cyrus provides further background information to inform his subjects who Yahweh is. Alternate translation: “Yahweh, the God whom the people of Israel worship, whose temple is in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EZR	1	4	t7ux		וְ⁠כָל־הַ⁠נִּשְׁאָ֗ר מִֽ⁠כָּל־הַ⁠מְּקֹמוֹת֮ אֲשֶׁ֣ר ה֣וּא גָֽר־שָׁם֒ יְנַשְּׂא֨וּ⁠הוּ֙ אַנְשֵׁ֣י מְקֹמ֔⁠וֹ	1	Whoever survives in any place where he lives, let the people in that place help him	The structure of this sentence may present difficulties for some readers because the long phrase at the beginning actually describes who will receive the action, rather than who will do the action. To make things clearer for your readers, you could say first who will do the action. Alternate translation: “Let the people who live in any place where Jewish survivors are in exile help them”
EZR	1	4	fr03	figs-idiom	 וְ⁠כָל־הַ⁠נִּשְׁאָ֗ר	1		This phrase refers to any Israelite who is a surviving member of the group that was taken into exile, or who is a descendant of someone in that group. The word “remaining” refers to people who are “remaining” or “left over” from a larger group. In this context, that larger group is all of the Israelites who lived in the land of Judah before the Babylonians conquered it. Alternate translation: “any survivor of the Jews who were taken from their land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	1	4	vvzw	figs-idiom	מִֽ⁠כָּל־הַ⁠מְּקֹמוֹת֮ אֲשֶׁ֣ר ה֣וּא גָֽר־שָׁם֒	1		“Sojourning” means living somewhere other than one’s native land. “He” means a Jew such as described in the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “in any of the places where a Jew may be living in exile” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	1	4	uoep		אֲשֶׁ֣ר ה֣וּא גָֽר־שָׁם֒	1		Saying “where” and “there” together like this is a characteristic Hebrew construction, but it might represent an unnecessary duplication in your language. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could omit any translation of the word “there.”
EZR	1	4	p5jk	figs-gendernotations	יְנַשְּׂא֨וּ⁠הוּ֙ אַנְשֵׁ֣י מְקֹמ֔⁠וֹ	1		It is likely that both women and men would have helped to gather the supplies listed in the rest of this verse to support the returning Jews. So the term “men” here probably includes both groups. Alternate translation: “the people of that place should help him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
EZR	1	4	d9rn	figs-idiom	יְנַשְּׂא֨וּ⁠הוּ֙	1		“Lift” here is an idiom that means “help.” Alternate translation: “help him by providing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	1	4	f6tk	figs-explicit	הַ֨⁠נְּדָבָ֔ה	1		The book expects readers to know that these would be extra gifts, beyond the necessities already listed. They might include money to help rebuild the temple and vessels to be used in the temple, such as the ones listed in verses [7–11] (../01/07.md). Alternate translation: “any extra gifts they want to give” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	1	4	swvz	figs-metaphor	לְ⁠בֵ֥ית הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר בִּ⁠ירוּשָׁלִָֽם׃	1		“House” figuratively means a temple. Cyrus continues to speak of this temple as if it would be a house in which God lived, since God’s presence would be there. The book repeatedly uses the expressions “house,” “house of God,” and “house of Yahweh” to mean the temple in Jerusalem. It will be helpful to your readers if you translate these expressions consistently every time. Alternate translation: “the temple that the Jews will rebuild for God in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	1	5	i39z	grammar-connect-logic-result	 וַ⁠יָּק֜וּמוּ	1		This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous verses have described. Alternate translation: “In response to this decree” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	1	5	9gd0	figs-ellipsis	רָאשֵׁ֣י הָ⁠אָב֗וֹת	1		This is an abbreviated way of saying “the heads of father’s houses.” Alternate translation: “the clan leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	1	5	v371	bita-manmade	רָאשֵׁ֣י הָ⁠אָב֗וֹת	1		Among the Israelites, the expression “father’s house” or “house of the father” originally described an extended-family group. It later came to be used more generally to refer to a larger clan within a tribe. In this expression, the word “house” (which does not appear in the abbreviated version here) figuratively describes all the people descended from a particular person. The term views all of those descendants as if they were one household living together. Alternate translation: “the clan leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-manmade]])
EZR	1	5	bezo	bita-hq	רָאשֵׁ֣י	1		“Head” here is a figurative way of saying “leader.” Alternate translation: “leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	1	5	rt3n	translate-names	לִֽ⁠יהוּדָה֙ וּ⁠בִנְיָמִ֔ן	1		These are the names of two of the tribes of Israel. Alternate translation: “of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	1	5	s2yg	figs-metaphor	לְ⁠כֹ֨ל הֵעִ֤יר הָ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶת־רוּח֔⁠וֹ	1	with everyone whose spirit God had stirred up to go up	Here the book again speaks figuratively of God causing people to act by saying that he “stirred up” their spirits, the way winds might stir up calm waters and get them to move around. The meaning is that God directly influenced the hearts and wills of these clan leaders to get them to do something. Alternate translation: “all those whom God had led to act” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	1	5	ywuq	figs-idiom	לַ⁠עֲל֣וֹת	1		In this context, the term “arise” means to take action to get an enterprise under way. It does not indicate that these leaders had been sitting or lying down and that they stood up. Alternate translation: “started making preparations to travel to Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	1	6	2hv7	figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠כָל־סְבִיבֹֽתֵי⁠הֶם֙	1		“All” is an exaggeration for emphasis. Every person who lived near a returning Jew did not necessarily provide support. But the expression indicates that the Jews received very generous support from many of their neighbors. Alternate translation: “the people of their communities” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
EZR	1	6	wwg6	figs-bita-hq	חִזְּק֣וּ בִֽ⁠ידֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1	strengthened their hands	Here “hand” figuratively represents strength and power. This expression means that the neighbors of the Jews gave them greater capacity to act and fulfill their project by supplying them with the items listed. Alternate translation: “helped them by giving them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	1	6	sc2n		לְ⁠בַ֖ד עַל־כָּל־הִתְנַדֵּֽב׃	1		This is a reference to the “freewill offerings” that are also mentioned in verse [4] (../01/04.md). Alternate translation: “In addition, the people freely gave extra gifts.”
EZR	1	7	bt1u	figs-explicit	כְּלֵ֣י בֵית־יְהוָ֑ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר הוֹצִ֤יא נְבֽוּכַדְנֶצַּר֙ מִ⁠יר֣וּשָׁלִַ֔ם וַֽ⁠יִּתְּנֵ֖⁠ם בְּ⁠בֵ֥ית אֱלֹהָֽי⁠ו׃	1		“Vessels” refers to the bowls, basins, and other objects that are listed in verses [9] (../01/09.md) and [10] (../01/10.md). The book assumes that readers will know that this verse is describing how Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, took these items from the temple in Jerusalem and then put them, as trophies of conquest, in a temple devoted to his own gods. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the objects from the temple of Yahweh that Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had taken away from Jerusalem when he captured that city and put in the temple of his own gods” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	1	7	bwol	translate-names	נְבֽוּכַדְנֶצַּר֙	1		This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	1	8	emq3	figs-bita-hq	וַ⁠יּֽוֹצִיאֵ֗⁠ם כּ֚וֹרֶשׁ מֶ֣לֶךְ פָּרַ֔ס עַל־יַ֖ד מִתְרְדָ֣ת	1		Here “hand” figuratively represents control and action. The expression means that Mithredath did this at the command of Cyrus and on his behalf. Alternate translation: “King Cyrus of Persia had his treasurer Mithredath bring them out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	1	8	832q	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יּֽוֹצִיאֵ֗⁠ם כּ֚וֹרֶשׁ מֶ֣לֶךְ פָּרַ֔ס עַל־יַ֖ד מִתְרְדָ֣ת	1		The implication is that these vessels had remained in the temple where Nebuchadnezzar had put them, and so Mithredath brought them out from there. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “King Cyrus of Persia had his treasurer Mithredath bring these vessels out from the temple where Nebuchadnezzar had put them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	1	8	m5w3	translate-names	מִתְרְדָ֣ת	1	Mithredath…Sheshbazzar	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	1	8	wc54	translate-unknown	הַ⁠גִּזְבָּ֑ר	1	brought them out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer	This term describes the office of a person responsible for all the valuable possessions of a monarch and for the places where they are stored safely. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EZR	1	8	w8rk	figs-idiom	וַֽ⁠יִּסְפְּרֵ⁠ם֙ לְ⁠שֵׁשְׁבַּצַּ֔ר	1	treasurer	“He” means Mithredath, and “them” means the objects for the temple. This expression means that Mithredath not only gave Sheshbazzar the objects, he also gave him a detailed accounting of how many there were of each kind, as recorded in verses [9] (../01/09.md) and [10] (../01/10.md). This likely does not mean that Mithredath handed Sheshbazzar the objects one at a time while announcing the number of each one. Alternate translation: “Mithredath turned them over to Sheshbazzar along with a detailed list of them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	1	8	xkar	translate-names	לְ⁠שֵׁשְׁבַּצַּ֔ר	1		This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	1	8	wb5a	translate-names	לְ⁠שֵׁשְׁבַּצַּ֔ר	1		This leader of the first group of exiles to return to Judah, who is called Sheshbazzar here and in [1:11] (../01/11.md), [5:14] (../05/14.md), and [5:16] (../05/16.md), seems to be the same person who is called Zerubbabel in the rest of the book. The reason for the difference in names is not clear. Some interpreters suggest that he was known as Sheshbazzar in the Persian court and that he used the name Zerubbabel as governor of Judah. It would probably be best simply to translate both names consistently where they appear without calling attention to the difference and trying to explain it, since there is no clear and generally accepted explanation for it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	1	8	qsti		הַ⁠נָּשִׂ֖יא לִ⁠יהוּדָֽה׃	1		The book says in [5:14] (../05/14.md) that Cyrus appointed Sheshbazzar to be the governor of the province of Judah. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use that phrase to describe him here. Alternate translation: “the governor of the province of Judah”
EZR	1	9	hu9c	figs-idiom	 וְ⁠אֵ֖לֶּה מִסְפָּרָ֑⁠ם	1	General Information:	This expression means, “This is how many there were of each kind of utensil.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	1	10	ja6u		כְּפ֤וֹרֵי כֶ֨סֶף֙ מִשְׁנִ֔ים	1	bowls	This means that these bowls were a different type of bowl than the gold ones just mentioned. It does not mean that the silver was of a different type than the silver in the basins described in verse [9] (../01/09.md).
EZR	1	11	z55f		כָּל־כֵּלִים֙ לַ⁠זָּהָ֣ב וְ⁠לַ⁠כֶּ֔סֶף חֲמֵ֥שֶׁת אֲלָפִ֖ים וְ⁠אַרְבַּ֣ע מֵא֑וֹת	1	5400	This expression means, “The total number of these gold and silver objects was 5,400.” Verses [9] (../01/09.md) and [10] (../01/10.md) actually list only 2,499 items, and it is not clear why the numbers are different. The explanation does not seem to be that the total here includes other miscellaneous items, because the last item on the list itself is “other vessels.” It would probably be best simply to report this total without calling attention to the difference and trying to explain it, since there is no clear reason for it.

EZR	2	63	n2du	translate-unknown	לְ⁠אוּרִ֥ים וּ⁠לְ⁠תֻמִּֽים	1	Urim and Thummim	This was a pair of objects that the high priest kept in the breastpiece of his robe. It is unknown exactly what type of objects they were, but they were used to answer yes-or-no questions and to decide between two alternatives. If the priest, without looking, pulled out the Urim, that meant one answer, while if he pulled out the Thummim, that meant the other answer. If it would be clearer in your language, you could describe these objects by their function rather than by their names. Alternate translation: “and could use the sacred objects to decide their cases.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Instead, you might say something general like “61,000 gold coins,” or give the equivalent weight, or use the biblical term in the text and give the weight in a note. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
EZR	2	69	ln9c	translate-bmoney	וְ⁠כֶ֕סֶף מָנִ֖ים חֲמֵ֣שֶׁת אֲלָפִ֑ים	1	minas	In ancient times, a silver mina weighed about half a kilogram, or about 1.25 pounds. However, as in the case of darics, it would probably be best to say something general like “2,200 silver bars,” or give the equivalent weight, or use the biblical term and give the equivalent weight in a note. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
EZR	2	69	h3zd	translate-unknown	וְ⁠כָתְנֹ֥ת כֹּהֲנִ֖ים מֵאָֽה	1	tunics	These were the special garments that priests would wear while performing their duties in the temple. Alternate translation: “100 special garments for the priests to wear” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EZR	2	70	w7fw		וַ⁠יֵּשְׁב֣וּ הַ⁠כֹּהֲנִ֣ים וְ֠⁠הַ⁠לְוִיִּם וּֽ⁠מִן־הָ⁠עָ֞ם וְ⁠הַ⁠מְשֹׁרְרִ֧ים וְ⁠הַ⁠שּׁוֹעֲרִ֛ים וְ⁠הַ⁠נְּתִינִ֖ים בְּ⁠עָרֵי⁠הֶ֑ם וְ⁠כָל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל בְּ⁠עָרֵי⁠הֶֽם׃	1	and all Israel lived in their cities	This is a summary conclusion to the list. See how you translated each of these terms within the list: “priests” in v. [36] (../02/36.md), “Levites” in v. [40] (../02/40.md), “singers” in v. [41] (../02/41.md), “gatekeepers” in v. [42] (../02/42.md), and “Nethinim” in v. [43] (../02/43.md). Review the notes to each of these verses if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “So the priests, Levites, other Israelites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants returned to Judah and settled in the places where their ancestors had formerly lived.”
EZR	2	70	1g6o	figs-parallelism	וְ⁠כָל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל בְּ⁠עָרֵי⁠הֶֽם	1		This sentence repeats the meaning of the previous sentence, perhaps for emphasis, to show that the return was accomplished successfully. You do not need to translate this sentence separately if that might be confusing for your readers. Its meaning is included in the alternate translation suggested for the previous sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

EZR	3	1	us0g	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יִּגַּע֙	1		This word indicates that the events the story will now relate came after the event it has just described. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship by using a fuller phrase. Alternate translation: “Once this group had returned to Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EZR	3	1	lr47	figs-explicit	 וַ⁠יִּגַּע֙ הַ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1		This phrase refers to the beginning of the seventh month in the Jewish religious calendar, which is the first month in the Jewish civic calendar. The phrase is actually giving the reason why the people gathered in Jerusalem at this time. It was the start of a new year, and the leadership had decided to resume community worship, including daily sacrifices, as of the beginning of that year, as verse [6] (../02/06.md) indicates. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “at the start of the seventh month, because it was the beginning of a new civic year” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	1	984e	translate-ordinal	הַ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1		Alternate translation: “month seven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EZR	3	1	a2ka	translate-hebrewmonths	הַ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1	the seventh month	You could convert the Hebrew month into an equivalent on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the equivalency will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to use the number of the Hebrew month. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
EZR	3	1	d1d0	figs-informremind	וּ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל בֶּ⁠עָרִ֑יםס וַ⁠יֵּאָסְפ֥וּ הָ⁠עָ֛ם ... אֶל־יְרוּשָׁלִָֽם	1		Here the book repeats some background information to remind readers why the Israelites were not all in Jerusalem already and would have had to come there from various places. Alternate translation: “the Israelites came from the different places where they had settled and they gathered in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EZR	3	1	vth3	bita-hq	וּ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1		“Sons” here figuratively means “descendants.” The book is envisioning all of the Israelites as descendants of the patriarch Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “the Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	3	1	hh94	figs-activepassive	 וַ⁠יֵּאָסְפ֥וּ הָ⁠עָ֛ם	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “they gathered together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	3	1	hwv6	figs-idiom	כְּ⁠אִ֥ישׁ אֶחָ֖ד	1	as one man	“As one man” is an idiom that means “as if they were a single person,” that is, all in once place at the same time for the same purpose. Alternate translation: “in a huge crowd” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	3	2	hbk8	grammar-connect-time-sequential	 וַ⁠יָּקָם֩	1		This word indicates that the events the story will now relate came after the event it has just described. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship by using a fuller phrase. Alternate translation: “Once everyone had gathered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EZR	3	2	s7ds	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יָּקָם֩	1		In this context, the word “arise” means to take action to get an enterprise under way. It does not indicate that these leaders had been sitting or lying down and that they stood up. Alternate translation: “took action” or “carried out their plans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	3	2	ua8i	translate-names	יֵשׁ֨וּעַ בֶּן־יֽוֹצָדָ֜ק	1	Jeshua	Jeshua is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [2:2] (../02/02.md). Jozadak is the name of his father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	3	2	o0k8	bita-hq	וְ⁠אֶחָ֣י⁠ו הַ⁠כֹּהֲנִ֗ים	1		Here “brothers” is likely a figurative way of saying “fellow priests,” although it is possible that some of the biological brothers of Jeshua were included in this group. Jeshua himself was the high priest at this time. Alternate translation: “his fellow priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	3	2	gq2e	translate-names	וּ⁠זְרֻבָּבֶ֤ל בֶּן־שְׁאַלְתִּיאֵל֙	1	Shealtiel	Zerubbabel is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [2:2] (../02/02.md). Shealtiel is the name of his father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	3	2	03ra	bita-hq	וְ⁠אֶחָ֔י⁠ו	1		Here “brothers” appears to be a figurative way of saying “fellow leaders.” The other seven men listed in [2:2] (../02/02.md) as leaders of the group that returned from exile may be particularly in view. Alternate translation: “his fellow leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	3	2	yy1u	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּבְנ֕וּ אֶת־מִזְבַּ֖ח אֱלֹהֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל לְ⁠הַעֲל֤וֹת עָלָי⁠ו֙ עֹל֔וֹת	1	rose up and built	This was a way of resuming regular community worship even before construction began on the new temple. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “They built a new altar to the God of Israel so that the priests could start offering sacrifices right away on behalf of the community.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	2	0qvh	figs-explicit	עֹל֔וֹת	1		The book assumes that readers will know that this means whole burnt offerings, that is, sacrifices that were burned up completely on the altar. These were offered to express a desire to be in good standing with God, through the complete sacrifice of something valuable and also through the creation of an aroma, the smell of roasting meat, that was considered to be pleasing to God. If your language has a special term for such offerings, you can use it in your translation. Alternate translation: “whole burnt offerings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	2	eg3w	figs-activepassive	כַּ⁠כָּת֕וּב בְּ⁠תוֹרַ֖ת מֹשֶׁ֥ה	1	as it is written in the law of Moses	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “as God had commanded the people of Israel to do through Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	3	2	gjpk	figs-informremind	מֹשֶׁ֥ה אִישׁ־הָ⁠אֱלֹהִֽים	1		Here the book repeats some background information to remind readers who Moses was. Alternate translation: “Moses, that godly man” or “Moses, that man who knew God well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EZR	3	2	h7xj	translate-names	מֹשֶׁ֥ה	1		This is the name of a man. It occurs many times throughout the book, and it will be helpful to your readers if you translate it consistently each time.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	3	3	7o49	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יָּכִ֤ינוּ הַ⁠מִּזְבֵּ֨חַ֙ עַל־מְכ֣וֹנֹתָ֔י⁠ו כִּ֚י בְּ⁠אֵימָ֣ה עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֔ם מֵ⁠עַמֵּ֖י הָ⁠אֲרָצ֑וֹת	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Because they were afraid of the people from other groups who lived around them, thinking they might attack them, they wanted to ask God for help and protection, so they made rebuilding the altar their first priority,” or, “Because they were afraid of the people from other groups who lived around them, thinking they might try to stop them from rebuilding the temple, they wanted to get started on rebuilding as quickly as possible, and so they began right away with the altar.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	3	3	t8y7	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּכִ֤ינוּ הַ⁠מִּזְבֵּ֨חַ֙ עַל־מְכ֣וֹנֹתָ֔י⁠ו	1	they set the altar on its foundation	This phrase likely means that the priests and leaders built this new altar right at the place where the altar had been located within the former temple. You could say that as an alternate translation if it would help make things clearer for your readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	3	bk73	figs-explicit	כִּ֚י בְּ⁠אֵימָ֣ה עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֔ם מֵ⁠עַמֵּ֖י הָ⁠אֲרָצ֑וֹת	1	dread was on them	The book does not say specifically why the Israelites were afraid of the people from other groups who lived around them. Two possibilities are that they were afraid these people might attack them, or that they might try to keep them from rebuilding the temple, in both cases to stop them from re-establishing themselves in their former homeland. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could suggest one of these explanations explicitly. Alternate translation: “because they were afraid that the people from other groups who lived around them might attack them, they wanted to ask God for help and protection” or “because they were afraid that the people from other groups who lived around them might try to stop them from rebuilding the temple, they wanted to get started on rebuilding as quickly as possible.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	3	53m4	figs-personification	בְּ⁠אֵימָ֣ה עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1		Here the book speaks figuratively of dread or fear as if it were a living thing that could land on or rest on the Israelites. Alternate translation: “they were very afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-]])
EZR	3	3	c33h	figs-idiom	מֵ⁠עַמֵּ֖י הָ⁠אֲרָצ֑וֹת	1	because of the people of the land	This was the expression that the Jews used to refer to members of other people groups, including some that the Assyrians had brought into the area, who were originally from other places (“lands”), but who were now living in and around the province of Judah. Alternate translation: “people from other groups” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	3	3	a9a2	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַיַּעֲל֨וּ עָלָ֤י⁠ו עֹלוֹת֙ לַֽ⁠יהוָ֔ה עֹל֖וֹת לַ⁠בֹּ֥קֶר וְ⁠לָ⁠עָֽרֶב	1	They offered on it burnt offerings to Yahweh, both the morning and evening burnt offerings	The word at the beginning of this sentence indicates that the activity it describes took place after the events the story has been describing. Specifically, this was a continuous activity, not something the leaders did just on that occasion. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship by using a phrase such as “from that time on.” Alternate translation: “From that time on, the priests offered sacrifices to Yahweh on this altar every morning and every evening.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EZR	3	3	vc8u	figs-explicit	וַיַּעֲל֨וּ עָלָ֤י⁠ו עֹלוֹת֙ לַֽ⁠יהוָ֔ה עֹל֖וֹת לַ⁠בֹּ֥קֶר וְ⁠לָ⁠עָֽרֶב	1		As verse [2] (../03/02.md) notes, God had commanded these daily offerings in the Law of Moses. By resuming them, the leaders and priests were restoring the regular worship life of the community. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “From that time on, the priests offered sacrifices to Yahweh on this altar every morning and every evening. By doing that, they restored the regular worship life of the community.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	4	9qln	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲשׂ֛וּ	1		This word indicates that the events the story will now recount came after the event it has just related. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship by using an equivalent phrase. The next event is specifically the Festival of Tabernacles, which the Law of Moses said to observe from the fifteenth through the twenty-second days of the seventh month. So that event would have taken place about two weeks after the Israelites first gathered in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “later that month” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EZR	3	4	iej2	figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲשׂ֛וּ אֶת־חַ֥ג הַ⁠סֻּכּ֖וֹת	1	the Festival of Shelters	This phrase describes the Israelites celebrating an observance that is also known as the Festival of Tabernacles. The purpose of this festival was to remind the Israelites how Yahweh had cared for their ancestors when they lived in temporary shelters as they traveled through the wilderness from Egypt to Canaan. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The Israelites celebrated the Festival of Tabernacles to remember how God had taken care of their ancestors when they had only temporary shelters to live in as they traveled through the wilderness from Egypt to Canaan.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	4	1687	figs-activepassive	כַּ⁠כָּת֑וּב	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “as God had commanded the people of Israel to do through Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	3	4	ka3d	figs-explicit	⁠עֹלַ֨ת י֤וֹם בְּ⁠יוֹם֙ בְּ⁠מִסְפָּ֔ר כְּ⁠מִשְׁפַּ֖ט דְּבַר־י֥וֹם בְּ⁠יוֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1		These expressions refer to the way the Law of Moses commanded the Israelites to offer a different number of sacrifices on each of the eight days of this festival. Alternate translation: “They offered burnt offerings every day, and on each day they offered the number of sacrifices that the law specified for that day.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	5	r95n	grammar-connect-time-sequential	 וְ⁠אַחֲרֵי כֵ֞ן	1		This phrase indicates that the activity it describes took place after the one it has just described. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship by using a phrase such as “from that time on.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EZR	3	5	yg77	figs-ellipsis	עֹלַ֤ת תָּמִיד֙ וְ⁠לֶ֣⁠חֳדָשִׁ֔ים וּ⁠לְ⁠כָל־מוֹעֲדֵ֥י יְהוָ֖ה הַ⁠מְקֻדָּשִׁ֑ים וּ⁠לְ⁠כֹ֛ל מִתְנַדֵּ֥ב נְדָבָ֖ה לַ⁠יהוָֽה	1		Here the book leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. The meaning seems to be that once the daily morning and evening sacrifices had been re-instituted, the less frequent sacrifices were resumed as well, including those for the new moon, for the annual festivals, and on the occasion of freewill offerings.  You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the priests offered sacrifices every morning and evening, and they also offered sacrifices for the new moon festivals, for the festivals that Yahweh had commanded them to observe each year, and whenever anyone freely offered an animal to Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	3	6	x3mt	translate-ordinal	מִ⁠יּ֤וֹם אֶחָד֙	1	from the first day of the seventh month	The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, “one,” but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, “first,” in similar contexts elsewhere. If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of days, you can do that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “Starting on the first day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EZR	3	6	cz5p	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	הֵחֵ֕לּוּ לְ⁠הַעֲל֥וֹת עֹל֖וֹת לַ⁠יהוָ֑ה וְ⁠הֵיכַ֥ל יְהוָ֖ה לֹ֥א יֻסָּֽד	1		This sentence draws a contrast between the conditions under which readers would have expected sacrifices to resume and the conditions under which they actually did resume. You could use a connecting phrase such as “even though” between the two clauses to indicate this contrast. Alternate translation: “they resumed offering sacrifices to Yahweh, even though they had not yet rebuilt the temple of Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EZR	3	6	cip8	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הֵיכַ֥ל יְהוָ֖ה לֹ֥א יֻסָּֽד	1	although the foundation of the temple of Yahweh had not been laid	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders had not yet rebuilt the temple of Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	3	6	qiw8	figs-synecdoche	⁠הֵיכַ֥ל יְהוָ֖ה לֹ֥א יֻסָּֽד	1		This phrase likely means specifically that no one had laid a foundation yet for the new temple. That would have been the first step in construction. However, this seems to be a figurative way of describing the entire process of building the temple by referring to one part of that process, its first step. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders had not yet rebuilt the temple of Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EZR	3	7	1mxu	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּ֨תְּנוּ	1		This word indicates that the sentence it introduces will explain what people did as a result of the situation that the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “And so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	3	7	y5sm	figs-explicit	 וַ⁠יִּ֨תְּנוּ־כֶ֔סֶף לַ⁠חֹצְבִ֖ים וְ⁠לֶ⁠חָרָשִׁ֑ים	1		The implication is that the Jewish leaders did this, and the rest of the things the verse describes, in order to start construction on the new temple. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “in order to start building a new temple, they hired masons and carpenters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	7	kpjx	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּ֨תְּנוּ־כֶ֔סֶף לַ⁠חֹצְבִ֖ים וְ⁠לֶ⁠חָרָשִׁ֑ים	1		“Give” is an idiom that means the Jewish leaders paid money to these workers in exchange for their expected labor. The money was not a gift. Alternate translation: “they hired masons and carpenters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	3	7	sqt7		וַ⁠יִּ֨תְּנוּ־כֶ֔סֶף	1		“Silver” here means money. Though the payment may well have been in the form of silver coins, such as are described in [2:69] (../02/69.md), the value of the payment is in view. The book is describing that value figuratively by reference to something associated with it, the silver that served as the medium of exchange. Alternate translation: “they paid money” or “they hired”
EZR	3	7	hm3b	translate-unknown	לַ⁠חֹצְבִ֖ים	1		This term describes workers who build things from stone. Alternate translation: “stoneworkers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EZR	3	7	q3ku	translate-unknown	וְ⁠לֶ⁠חָרָשִׁ֑ים	1		This term describes workers who build things from wood. Alternate translation: “woodworkers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EZR	3	7	4nzd	figs-idiom	וּ⁠מַאֲכָ֨ל וּ⁠מִשְׁתֶּ֜ה וָ⁠שֶׁ֗מֶן לַ⁠צִּֽדֹנִים֙ וְ⁠לַ⁠צֹּרִ֔ים	1		This phrase describes a further step that the Jewish leaders took to rebuild the temple. The words “they gave” earlier in the sentence apply to this phrase as well. “Gave” would now have the sense of “sent,” since the leaders made this payment in kind rather than in cash. Alternate translation: “They also sent grain and wine and olive oil to the people who lived in the cities of Sidon and Tyre.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	3	7	i65c	figs-synecdoche	וּ⁠מַאֲכָ֨ל וּ⁠מִשְׁתֶּ֜ה וָ⁠שֶׁ֗מֶן	1		While these are all general terms that describe categories of things, the book is likely using them to refer figuratively to specific items within each category. “Food” means anything to eat, but here it probably means one kind of food, grain, which the Israelites grew in their land and which they could transport relatively easily. “Drink” means anything to drink, but it probably means wine, and “oil” probably means olive oil, because these were both also things that the Israelites produced and could transport. Alternate translation: “grain and wine and olive oil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EZR	3	7	zqr4	translate-names	לַ⁠צִּֽדֹנִים֙ וְ⁠לַ⁠צֹּרִ֔ים	1		These are the names of two people groups. The terms describe the residents of the cities of Sidon and Tyre, which were located on the seacoast north of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	3	7	yj5k	grammar-connect-logic-goal	לְ⁠הָבִיא֩	1		This phrase describes the purpose for which the Jewish leaders took the actions just described. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a term such as “so that” to indicate this. Alternate translation: “so that they would bring” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
EZR	3	7	i1u7	translate-unknown	עֲצֵ֨י אֲרָזִ֤ים	1		The term “cedar” refers to a large fir tree with strong, beautiful, aromatic wood that was valued for construction. Such trees grew plentifully and to great heights in the region of Lebanon. Alternate translation: “cedar trees” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EZR	3	7	zvt6	figs-idiom	מִן־הַ⁠לְּבָנוֹן֙ אֶל־יָ֣ם יָפ֔וֹא	1		The “sea of Joppa” is not the name of a body of water. Instead, that term refers to the coast of the Mediterranean Sea at the port city of Joppa. This full phrase means that the people of Tyre and Sidon were to cut cedar trees in Lebanon and transport them to Israel by floating them along the seacoast to the port of Joppa. Alternate translation: “by sea from Lebanon to Joppa” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	3	7	gq2g	translate-names	הַ⁠לְּבָנוֹן֙	1		This is the name of a place. It was a mountainous region located along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, north of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	3	7	kya8	translate-names	יָפ֔וֹא	1		This is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	3	7	ze22	figs-activepassive	כְּ⁠רִשְׁי֛וֹן כּ֥וֹרֶשׁ מֶֽלֶךְ־פָּרַ֖ס עֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	according to the permission they had from King Cyrus of Persia	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “King Cyrus of Persia had authorized them to do this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	3	7	5fm5	grammar-connect-logic-result	כְּ⁠רִשְׁי֛וֹן כּ֥וֹרֶשׁ מֶֽלֶךְ־פָּרַ֖ס עֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could put this sentence first in the verse, since it gives the reason for the actions that the rest of the verse describes. You could also show the connection by beginning the next sentence with a phrase such as “and so.” Alternate translation: “King Cyrus of Persia had authorized the Jewish leaders to get the materials they needed to rebuild the temple.

EZR	3	8	ayx1	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וּ⁠בַ⁠שָּׁנָ֣ה הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֗ית ... בַּ⁠חֹ֖דֶשׁ הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֑י	1		The word at the beginning of this phrase indicates that the events the story will now relate came after the events it has just described. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship by saying something like, “Then, in the second month of the second year.” You could also indicate the specific amount of time that had passed since the time of the earlier events by saying something like, “Then, seven months later.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EZR	3	8	e0js	translate-ordinal	וּ⁠בַ⁠שָּׁנָ֣ה הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֗ית ... בַּ⁠חֹ֖דֶשׁ הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֑י	1		Alternate translation: “in month 2 of year 2” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EZR	3	8	eh5s	translate-hebrewmonths	וּ⁠בַ⁠שָּׁנָ֣ה הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֗ית ... בַּ⁠חֹ֖דֶשׁ הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֑י	1	in the second month	You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to use the numbers of the Hebrew day and month. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
EZR	3	8	rs79	figs-explicit	וּ⁠בַ⁠שָּׁנָ֣ה הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֗ית לְ⁠בוֹאָ֞⁠ם אֶל־בֵּ֤ית הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙ לִ⁠יר֣וּשָׁלִַ֔ם	1		At this time, there was no temple in Jerusalem. So this phrase likely means one of two things. (1) The book could be referring implicitly to the purpose for which they came. In that case it would mean, “in the second year after they returned to Jerusalem in order to build a new temple there.” (2) The book could also be describing the return to Judah generally by referring to one prominent place in Judah, the temple site in Jerusalem. In that case it would mean, “in the second year after they returned from exile to the province of Judah to resettle there.” You could say either of those things as an alternate translation if that would be helpful to your readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EZR	3	8	y8bn	figs-metaphor	בֵּ֤ית הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙	1	to the house of God	Alternate translation: “the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	3	8	ckj4	figs-explicit	בַּ⁠חֹ֖דֶשׁ הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֑י	1	in the second year	The book does not say explicitly why the Jewish leaders started the actual construction of the new temple at this time. One possibility is that once they had ordered the necessary materials, as verse [7](../03/07.md) describes, it took seven months for enough materials to be delivered for construction to begin. Another possibility is that the leaders waited until spring because winter would have been a bad time to start building. Yet another possibility is that they wanted to lay the foundation of this new temple in the second month of the year for ceremonial reasons, because that was the month in which King Solomon had laid the foundation of the original temple. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say one of these things explicitly. Alternate translation: “in the second month, once they had received sufficient materials” or “in the second month, once the spring weather came” or “in the second month, the same month when King Solomon laid the foundation of the first temple.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	8	wwz8	translate-names	זְרֻבָּבֶ֣ל בֶּן־שְׁ֠אַלְתִּיאֵל	1		Zerubbabel is the name of a man, and Shealtiel is the name of his father. See how you translated these names in [3:2] (../03/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	3	8	fa38	translate-names	וְ⁠יֵשׁ֨וּעַ בֶּן־יֽוֹצָדָ֜ק	1	Jeshua…Jozadak	Jeshua is the name of a man, and Jozadak is the name of his father. See how you translated these names in [3:2] (../03/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	3	8	bzi5	bita-hq	וּ⁠שְׁאָ֥ר אֲחֵי⁠הֶ֣ם׀ הַ⁠כֹּהֲנִ֣ים וְ⁠הַ⁠לְוִיִּ֗ם	1		Here “brothers” seems to be a figurative way of saying “fellow leaders,” since the priests and Levites were also leaders in the community like Zerubbabel the governor and Jeshua the high priest. Alternate translation: “their fellow leaders, the priests and Levites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	3	8	hy61	figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠כָל־הַ⁠בָּאִים֙ מֵ⁠הַ⁠שְּׁבִ֣י	1		The abstract noun “captivity” refers to the way the Babylonians had transported many of the Jews away from their homeland when they conquered Jerusalem. (These included many of the parents or grandparents of the people here, but also some of these people themselves, as verse [12] (../03/12.md) indicates.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “and the rest of the people who had returned to Jerusalem from where their enemies had taken them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	3	8	8yam	figs-ellipsis	הֵחֵ֡לּוּ	1		Here the book leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. This most likely means “began to build a new temple.” You could say that as an alternate translation if it would be helpful to your readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	3	8	tliz	grammar-connect-logic-goal	וַ⁠יַּעֲמִ֣ידוּ	1		This phrase describes the purpose for which the Jewish leaders took the actions that the rest of the verse describes. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a term such as “so” to indicate this. Alternate translation: “so they appointed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
EZR	3	8	hf5n	figs-idiom	אֶת־הַ⁠לְוִיִּ֗ם מִ⁠בֶּ֨ן עֶשְׂרִ֤ים שָׁנָה֙ וָ⁠מַ֔עְלָ⁠ה	1	from twenty years old	Here “son of” is an idiom that indicates a person’s age. Alternate translation: “the Levites who were at least 20 years old” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	3	8	7yhg	figs-ellipsis	לְ⁠נַצֵּ֖חַ עַל־מְלֶ֥אכֶת בֵּית־יְהוָֽה	1		In this context, “the work of the house” is an abbreviated way of referring to the project of constructing a new temple. Alternate translation: “to supervise the construction of a new temple for Yahweh.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	3	8	jfho		בֵּית־יְהוָֽה	1		See how you translated this expression in [1:3] (../01/03.md). Alternate translation: “a new temple for Yahweh”
EZR	3	9	b5al	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יַּעֲמֹ֣ד	1		This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	3	9	s6i8	translate-names	יֵשׁ֡וּעַ	1	Jeshua…Henadad	This is the name of a man, but he is not the high priest mentioned in the previous verse. Rather, he is the Levite clan leader listed in [2:40] (../02/40.md) as one of the exiles who returned to Judah. See how you translated his name there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	3	9	up2g		בָּנָ֣י⁠ו וְ֠⁠אֶחָי⁠ו	1		The terms “sons” and “brothers” do not seem to be figurative here, as those terms likely are later in the verse. Rather, they would describe the biological sons and brothers of Jeshua as people who worked closely with him in supervising the construction of the new temple. So it would be appropriate to use the usual terms in your language for these close relationships.
EZR	3	9	r3rx	translate-names	קַדְמִיאֵ֨ל	1	Kadmiel	This is the name of a man. He is another Levite clan leader listed in [2:40] (../02/40.md). See how you translated his name there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	3	9	sc2u		וּ⁠בָנָ֤י⁠ו	1		Here as well the term “sons” does not seem to be figurative. Rather, it describes the biological sons of Kadmiel as people who helped supervise the temple construction.
EZR	3	9	34q7	bita-hq	בְּנֵֽי־יְהוּדָה֙	1		But here “sons” does figuratively mean “descendants.” As [2:40] (../02/40.md) explains, Jeshua and Kadmiel were the leaders of two Levite clans that were both descended from a man named Hodaviah. Alternate translation: “who were all descendants of Hodaviah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	3	9	mrij	translate-names	יְהוּדָה֙	1		This is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [2:40] (../02/40.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	3	9	4r9e	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּעֲמֹ֣ד ... כְּ⁠אֶחָ֔ד לְ⁠נַצֵּ֛חַ עַל־עֹשֵׂ֥ה הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֖ה	1		As in [2:63] (../02/63.md), “stood” is a figurative way of saying that a person assumed the duties of their office. Alternate translation: “joined together to supervise the workers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	3	9	myu1	figs-idiom	כְּ⁠אֶחָ֔ד	1		“As one” is an idiom that means these men all behaved as if they were a single person, that is, they all did the same thing, they worked unitedly towards a common goal. Alternate translation: “together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	3	9	mgw2		הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֖ה בְּ⁠בֵ֣ית הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1		As in [2:69] (../02/69.md) and [3:8] (../03/08.md), “the work” means the project of rebuilding the temple. Alternate translation: “the workers who were rebuilding the temple”
EZR	3	9	ihtd	figs-explicit	בְּנֵי֙ חֵֽנָדָ֔ד בְּנֵי⁠הֶ֥ם וַ⁠אֲחֵי⁠הֶ֖ם הַ⁠לְוִיִּֽם	1		The relationship of this list of names to the rest of the verse is not entirely clear. (1) One possibility is that it is a list of the people who did the actual construction work on the new temple, under the supervision of Jeshua, Kadmiel, and their relatives. (2) Another possibility is that the people listed here helped Jeshua, Kadmiel, and their relatives supervise other people who did the construction work. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say one of those things explicitly. Alternate translation: (1) “Those workers were the sons and grandsons of a man named Henadad and all the other Levites,” or, (2) “The sons and grandsons of a man named Henadad and all the other Levites helped them supervise the workers.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	9	q6vn	bita-hq	בְּנֵי֙ חֵֽנָדָ֔ד בְּנֵי⁠הֶ֥ם וַ⁠אֲחֵי⁠הֶ֖ם הַ⁠לְוִיִּֽם	1		(1) “Their” could refer to Jeshua and Kadmiel, in which case “their brothers the Levites” would be a figurative way of saying “their fellow Levites,” as opposed to the biological brothers mentioned earlier in the verse. The phrase would refer to all the other Levites who had returned from exile. (2) However, “their” could also refer to the sons of Henadad. It would still mean “fellow Levites,” and it would indicate that those men were Levites themselves. Alternate translation: (1) “the sons and grandsons of a man named Henadad and all the other Levites who had returned from exile” or (2) “the sons and grandsons of a man named Henadad and the others who were Levites as they were” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	3	9	nyal	translate-names	בְּנֵי֙ חֵֽנָדָ֔ד בְּנֵי⁠הֶ֥ם	1		The “sons of Henadad” seems to mean the actual sons of a man named Henadad. “Their sons” seems to mean the actual sons of those men. The book does not mention Henadad anywhere else and it does not provide any further information about him, so it would probably be best simply to state his name. Alternate translation: “the sons and grandsons of a man named Henadad” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	3	10	zkmw	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וְ⁠יִסְּד֥וּ הַ⁠בֹּנִ֖ים אֶת־הֵיכַ֣ל יְהוָ֑ה	1		The word at the beginning of this sentence indicates that it will describe something that took place after the event the story has just related. (Specifically, now that all the necessary supervisors were in place, the construction work could begin.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship by using a word such as “Then.” Alternate translation: “Then the builders laid the foundation of the new temple for Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EZR	3	10	w1j9	figs-explicit	 וְ⁠יִסְּד֥וּ ... אֶת־הֵיכַ֣ל	1	laid the foundation	This likely means that the workers had done more than set stone blocks in place to support the temple walls. They had probably set the entire temple floor in stone. This would have allowed many of the people who had come for this celebration to stand within the site of the future temple. It would also have enabled the priests to wear their special garments and keep them clean. Alternate translation: “set the temple floor in stone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	10	wkt7	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	 וְ⁠יִסְּד֥וּ	1		The word at the beginning of this sentence indicates that the event it describes took place at the same time as the event the story has just related. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship in this case by using a phrase such as “at that time.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
EZR	3	10	539g	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּעֲמִידוּ֩ הַ⁠כֹּהֲנִ֨ים מְלֻבָּשִׁ֜ים בַּ⁠חֲצֹֽצְר֗וֹת	1		As in [2:63] (../02/69.md) and [3:9] (../03/09.md), “stood” is a figurative way of saying that a person assumed the duties of their office. Alternate translation: “they had the priests come to the temple site wearing their sacred garments and play their trumpets” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	3	10	kh7e	figs-activepassive	מְלֻבָּשִׁ֜ים	1	in their garments	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind this passive verb form with a phrase that uses an active form. Alternate translation: “wearing their sacred garments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	3	10	dhpq	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠לְוִיִּ֤ם בְּנֵֽי־אָסָף֙ בַּֽ⁠מְצִלְתַּ֔יִם	1		The book expects readers to know that the Levites of this clan were vocal musicians who led the community in worship, particularly on ceremonial occasions such as this one. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and they had the Levites who were descendants of Asaph sing and play their cymbals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	10	i9ce	bita-hq	וְ⁠הַ⁠לְוִיִּ֤ם בְּנֵֽי־אָסָף֙	1		“Sons” here figuratively means “descendants” Alternate translation: “the Levites who were descendants of Asaph” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	3	10	fvas	translate-names	אָסָף֙	1		Asaph is a man’s name. See how you translated it in [2:41] (../02/41.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	3	10	v35v	translate-unknown	בַּֽ⁠מְצִלְתַּ֔יִם	1	with cymbals	Cymbals are two thin, round metal plates that are hit together to make a loud sound. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

So …” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result)
EZR	3	10	t64z	figs-bita-hq	יְדֵ֖י דָּוִ֥יד	1	the hands of David	Here the hands of a king are used figuratively to represent his power to give commands. Alternate translation: “as David had commanded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	3	10	3b0l	figs-informremind	דָּוִ֥יד מֶֽלֶךְ־יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1		Here the book provides some background information to describe more fully who David was. Alternate translation: “King David of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EZR	3	11	1jjk	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַֽ֠⁠יַּעֲנוּ	1		This word indicates that the sentence it introduces it will describe something that took place after the event the story has just related. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship by using an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “Once all the musicians were in place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EZR	3	11	3w1v		 וַֽ֠⁠יַּעֲנוּ	1		“They” means the Levite singers. “In response” means that first one group of them sang something, and then a second group of them sang something in reply, possibly playing instruments as well. The groups likely did this repeatedly over the course of a given song. Alternate translation: “the Levites sang responsively” or “the Levites sang antiphonally”
EZR	3	11	hgd5	figs-quotemarks	כִּ֣י ט֔וֹב כִּֽי־לְ⁠עוֹלָ֥ם חַסְדּ֖⁠וֹ עַל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	giving thanks	These are at least some of the words that the Levites sang on this occasion. Based on their other occurrences in the Bible, they may be the words to a refrain that the second group sang in response to verses that the first group sang. Or they may be the entire lyrics to a song that was sung for this celebration. Either way, it may be helpful to your readers to indicate that they are the words of the singers by setting off them with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	3	11	ut4a	figs-abstractnouns	כִּֽי־לְ⁠עוֹלָ֥ם חַסְדּ֖⁠וֹ עַל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	His covenant faithfulness to Israel is forever	The abstract noun “faithfulness” describes the quality of a person who will dependably keep their word and fulfill their responsibilities. “Covenant faithfulness” refers specifically to Yahweh keeping all of the promises he made to the people of Israel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this word with an expression such as “keep promises.” Alternate translation: “Yahweh always keeps the promises he made to Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	3	11	uqct	figs-activepassive	עַ֖ל הוּסַ֥ד בֵּית־יְהוָֽה	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “because the builders had laid the foundation of Yahweh’s temple” or “because the builders had set the temple floor in stone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) 
EZR	3	12	h0i1	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	 וְ⁠רַבִּ֡ים	1		This word indicates that the sentence it introduces will draw a contrast. That contrast is specifically between the joyful way readers would expect all the Israelites to have responded on this occasion and the sorrowful way that some of them responded. You could use a word such as “however” to indicate this contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EZR	3	12	4q1v	figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠רָאשֵׁ֨י הָ⁠אָב֜וֹת	1		As in [1:5] (../01/05.md), this is an abbreviated way of saying “the heads of father’s houses.” Review the explanatory note to this phrase in [1:5] (../01/05.md) if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “the clan leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	3	12	96gu	writing-background	הַ⁠זְּקֵנִ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֨ר רָא֜וּ אֶת־הַ⁠בַּ֤יִת	1		This phrase provides background information to identify these specific priests, Levites, and clan leaders further. Alternate translation: “who were old enough to have seen the first temple before it was destroyed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EZR	3	12	wzqy	figs-explicit	בֹּכִ֖ים בְּ⁠ק֣וֹל גָּד֑וֹל	1		The book does not say specifically why these older leaders who had seen the first temple were weeping. One possibility is that they felt grief and loss because they remembered the first temple in all of its glory and they could not imagine that this replacement would ever be as splendid. Another possibility is that seeing the community begin to restore its temple brought back memories of the terrible days in which the original temple had been destroyed and the people had had to leave their homes and go into exile. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say one of these things explicitly. Alternate translation: “wept loudly because they thought this new temple could never be as glorious as the first one” or “wept loudly because they remembered how the first temple had been destroyed” or just “wept loudly, remembering the past.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	12	yarf	figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠יָסְד֔⁠וֹ זֶ֤ה הַ⁠בַּ֨יִת֙ בְּ⁠עֵ֣ינֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1		As in verse [6] (../03/06.md), “founding” means to begin construction on a building. It is a reference to the first step, laying a foundation, though it may mean starting the project generally. “Eyes” figuratively represent sight. So this phrase means “when construction began on the temple in their sight.” Alternate translation: “began to weep when they saw the foundation that the builders had laid for this temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	3	12	xj13	figs-metaphor	אֶת־הַ⁠בַּ֤יִת הָֽ⁠רִאשׁוֹן֙ ... זֶ֤ה הַ⁠בַּ֨יִת֙	1	first house	As often in this book, “house” is a [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] for “temple.” Alternate translation: “the first temple … this temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	3	12	rmy5	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ⁠רַבִּ֛ים	1	before their eyes	The word “yet” indicates a contrast between what the people just described were doing and what the people who will be described next were doing. You could indicate this contrast by saying something like, “But many others.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EZR	3	12	d9tw	figs-idiom	וְ⁠רַבִּ֛ים בִּ⁠תְרוּעָ֥ה בְ⁠שִׂמְחָ֖ה לְ⁠הָרִ֥ים קֽוֹל	1	wept with a loud voice	To lift up a voice is an idiom that means to speak, shout, or sing loudly. Alternate translation: “many others were giving loud, happy shouts.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	3	12	onuv	figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠רַבִּ֛ים בִּ⁠תְרוּעָ֥ה בְ⁠שִׂמְחָ֖ה לְ⁠הָרִ֥ים קֽוֹל	1		The idea behind the abstract noun “joy” can be expressed with an adjective such as “happy.” Alternate translation: “many others were giving loud, happy shouts.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	3	13	isem	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠אֵ֣ין	1		This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	3	13	fpsh	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠אֵ֣ין הָ⁠עָ֗ם מַכִּירִים֙ ק֚וֹל תְּרוּעַ֣ת הַ⁠שִּׂמְחָ֔ה לְ⁠ק֖וֹל בְּכִ֣י הָ⁠עָ֑ם כִּ֣י הָ⁠עָ֗ם מְרִיעִים֙ תְּרוּעָ֣ה גְדוֹלָ֔ה	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because the people who were happy were shouting so loudly, no one at the ceremony could distinguish their cries from the weeping of those who had seen the first temple.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	3	13	u6pc	figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֵ֣ין הָ⁠עָ֗ם מַכִּירִים֙ ק֚וֹל תְּרוּעַ֣ת הַ⁠שִּׂמְחָ֔ה לְ⁠ק֖וֹל בְּכִ֣י הָ⁠עָ֑ם כִּ֣י הָ⁠עָ֗ם מְרִיעִים֙ תְּרוּעָ֣ה גְדוֹלָ֔ה	1		In its first occurrence here, the phrase “the people” means all the Israelites who had gathered for this ceremony. In its second occurrence, the phrase refers to one group of them, the older leaders who had seen the first temple and were weeping. In its third occurrence, it refers to another group of them, the younger Israelites who were shouting for joy. Alternate translation: “because the people who were happy were shouting so loudly, no one at the ceremony could distinguish their cries from the weeping of those who had seen the first temple.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	3	13	rvdj	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הַ⁠קּ֥וֹל נִשְׁמַ֖ע עַד־לְ⁠מֵ⁠רָחֽוֹק	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action.

You can translate it with the word or phrase in your language that is most similar in meaning and significance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EZR	4	1	miqb	figs-personification	יְהוּדָ֖ה וּ⁠בִנְיָמִ֑ן	0		Here the book is referring figuratively to the people who came from the tribe of Judah as if they were a single person, their ancestor Judah. It is referring similarly to the people of the tribe of Benjamin as if they were a single person, their ancestor Benjamin. Alternate translation: “the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin,” however, see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
EZR	4	1	i4dx	figs-hendiadys	יְהוּדָ֖ה וּ⁠בִנְיָמִ֑ן	0		Here the book may be expressing a single idea figuratively by using two words connected with “and.” Together the two words may be a way of referring to all of the Israelites, since at this point the community consisted essentially of people from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. Alternate translation: “the Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
EZR	4	1	vflf	figs-synecdoche	 וַֽ⁠יִּשְׁמְע֔וּ ... כִּֽי־בְנֵ֤י הַ⁠גּוֹלָה֙ בּוֹנִ֣ים הֵיכָ֔ל	0		“Heard” means that these enemies learned by some means that the Jews were doing this. The book is figuratively using hearing, one means of discovering things, to describe the enemies learning this. Alternate translation: “learned that the Jews who had returned from exile were building a temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EZR	4	1	syf6	figs-idiom	בְנֵ֤י הַ⁠גּוֹלָה֙	1		As indicated in [2:1](../02/01.md) and [8:35](../08/35.md), the phrase **the sons of the exile** refers specifically to the group of Jewish people who returned to the land of Judah from Babylon after King Nebuchadnezzar had conquered Jerusalem and has taken many Jews as captives to Babylon. Alternate translation: “the Jews who had returned from exile” or “the Jews who had returned to their homeland” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	1	czf3	figs-informremind	לַ⁠יהוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1		This phrase provides further background information about Yahweh and it likely expresses the perspective of the enemies on the situation. Alternate translation: “Yahweh, the God they worshipped” or “Yahweh, the God whom the people of Israel worshipped” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EZR	4	2	dkbu	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּגְּשׁ֨וּ	1		This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “as a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	4	2	spx4	translate-names	זְרֻבָּבֶ֜ל	1	Zerubbabel	This is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [2:2] (../02/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	2	zcwc	figs-ellipsis	רָאשֵׁ֣י הָֽ⁠אָב֗וֹת	1		As in [1:5] (../01/05.md) and elsewhere in the book, this is an abbreviated way of saying “the heads of father’s houses.” Alternate translation: “the clan leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	4	2	6xyv	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֤וּ לָ⁠הֶם֙ נִבְנֶ֣ה עִמָּ⁠כֶ֔ם	1		Since the book says in the previous verse that these people were enemies of the Jews, the implication is that they were not sincere when they claimed that they wanted to help build the temple. Instead, they were probably looking for a way to thwart the building project from within. The Jewish leaders refused their offer, and that suggests that they themselves suspected that these people were insincere. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say something like that explicitly. Alternate translation: “pretending to be sincere, they said to them, ‘We would like to help you build the temple …’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	2	yrms	figs-idiom	נִדְר֖וֹשׁ לֵֽ⁠אלֹהֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1		Here “seek” is an idiom that means to worship and pray to God or a god. Alternate translation: “we worship your God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	2	1fnu	figs-idiom	מִ⁠ימֵי֙ אֵסַ֤ר חַדֹּן֙	1		The term “days” is used figuratively here to refer a particular period of time. Alternate translation: “since the time of Esarhaddon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	2	yx1s	translate-names	אֵסַ֤ר חַדֹּן֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ אַשּׁ֔וּר	1	Esarhaddon, king of Assyria	Esarhaddon is the name of a man, and Assyria is the name of his kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	2	to8y	figs-idiom	הַ⁠מַּעֲלֶ֥ה אֹתָ֖⁠נוּ פֹּֽה	1		These men say that Esarhaddon brought them “up” to this land because it is mountainous and, as [4:9] (../04/09.md) indicates, their ancestors formerly lived in lowland areas. Alternate translation: “the one who brought us here” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	3	0kli	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	 וַ⁠יֹּאמֶר֩	1		This word indicates that the sentence it introduces draws a contrast between what the men asked and what the Jewish leaders were prepared to allow. You could begin the sentence with a word like “however” or “nevertheless” to indicate this contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EZR	4	3	xp3f	translate-names	זְרֻבָּבֶ֜ל וְ⁠יֵשׁ֗וּעַ	1	Jeshua	These are the names of two men. See how you translated them in [2:2] (../02/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	3	9bhq	figs-ellipsis	רָאשֵׁ֤י הָֽ⁠אָבוֹת֙	1		This is an abbreviated way of saying “the heads of father’s houses.” Alternate translation: “the clan leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	4	3	cuza	bita-manmade	רָאשֵׁ֤י הָֽ⁠אָבוֹת֙	1		See how you translated this expression in [1:5] (../01/05.md). Review the note there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “the clan leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-manmade]])
EZR	4	3	isv8	figs-idiom	לֹֽא־לָ֣⁠כֶם וָ⁠לָ֔⁠נוּ	1	You may not build a house for our God with us	This expression is an idiom that means “it is for us alone.” Alternate translation: “You may not help us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	3	bl6x	figs-metaphor	בַּ֖יִת לֵ⁠אלֹהֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1		Alternate translation: “a temple for our God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	4	3	jpin	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	כִּי֩	1		This word indicates that the clause it introduces draws a contrast between what the men asked and what the Jewish leaders were prepared to allow. To indicate this contrast, you could begin the sentence with a word or phrase such as “no,” “rather,” or “on the contrary.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EZR	4	3	2kgy	figs-exclusive	אֲנַ֨חְנוּ יַ֜חַד נִבְנֶ֗ה לַֽ⁠יהוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1		“We ourselves” here does not include the addressees. If your language marks that distinction, be sure that this is clear in your translation. “Together” does not mean the Jewish people and these foreign peoples together. It means the whole Jewish community together. Alternate translation: “It is all of us Israelites who will build a temple for Yahweh, the God of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
EZR	4	3	vez9	figs-informremind	אֱלֹהֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1		See the note to [4:1] (../04/01.md) about the significance of this phrase. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EZR	4	3	2qpr	figs-explicit	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר צִוָּ֔⁠נוּ הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ כּ֥וֹרֶשׁ מֶֽלֶךְ־פָּרָֽס	1		It is implicit in the story that the Jewish leaders know that they cannot trust these foreign leaders, whom the story describes as their “enemies.” The Jewish leaders suggest indirectly that they do not accept their claim to be devotees of Yahweh. They say, “It is not for you … to build a house for our God,” and they describe Yahweh as the “God of Israel” exclusively. But apparently they cannot contradict the claim directly, perhaps for reasons of etiquette and diplomacy. Instead, it seems that they find convenient grounds to exclude foreigners from the temple project in the literal wording of the proclamation that Cyrus issued: “Whoever among you is from all his people … may he build the house of Yahweh, the God of Israel.” It may be possible in your translation to translate this phrase in such a way that your readers will implicitly recognize it as the convenient excuse it apparently is. Alternate translation: “After all, that is what King Cyrus of Persia commanded.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	4	j0ej	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִי֙	1		In Hebrew storytelling, this is a common way of introducing a new event. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EZR	4	4	d9da	figs-idiom	עַם־הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	the people of the land	This expression refers to the non-Israelite people groups, listed in [4:9] (../04/09.md), whom the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal had brought to live in the area just north of Judah in the century before the Jews were taken away into exile themselves. When the Jews returned to their homeland, those foreign groups were still living nearby. Alternate translation: “the foreign people groups living nearby” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	4	n1m9	figs-parallelism	וַ⁠יְהִי֙…מְרַפִּ֖ים יְדֵ֣י עַם־יְהוּדָ֑ה וּֽמְבַהֲלִ֥ים אוֹתָ֖⁠ם לִ⁠בְנֽוֹת	1	made the hands of the people of Judah weak	These two phrases mean similar things. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “making the people of Judah so intimidated that they stopped working on the temple” However, there is a slight distinction between the phrases. The first one describes how the people felt inwardly, and the second one explains what effect this had on their outward actions. So you could also translate the phrases separately. Alternate translation: “intimidating the people of Judah, so that they were too afraid to keep working on the temple.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EZR	4	4	7ih7	figs-bita-hq	 וַ⁠יְהִי֙...מְרַפִּ֖ים יְדֵ֣י עַם־יְהוּדָ֑ה	1		Here “hand” figuratively represents power and action, so “weakening the hand” means to make someone so discouraged or intimidated that they do not use their power to act. Alternate translation: “intimidating the people of Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	4	4	aq32		עַם־יְהוּדָ֑ה	1	the people of Judah	In this context, this expression does not mean all the inhabitants of the province of Judah, whatever their nationality, but rather specifically the Jews who returned from exile and settled there. Alternate translation: “the Jews who had returned from exile and settled in the province of Judah”
EZR	4	5	7dut	translate-unknown	וְ⁠סֹכְרִ֧ים עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֛ם יוֹעֲצִ֖ים	1		“Counselors” means royal advisors in the Persian court. The enemies of the Jews were bribing them to try to get them to influence the king against the Jews. Alternate translation: “bribing royal advisors to work against the Jews in the Persian court” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EZR	4	5	kd9a		לְ⁠הָפֵ֣ר עֲצָתָ֑⁠ם	1	to frustrate their plans	Alternate translation: “to keep them from successfully rebuilding the temple”
EZR	4	5	jlap	figs-idiom	כָּל־יְמֵ֗י כּ֚וֹרֶשׁ מֶ֣לֶךְ פָּרַ֔ס	1		The term “days” is used figuratively here to refer to a particular period of time. In this context, it would mean specifically the nine years from 538 BC, when Cyrus conquered Babylon and became ruler of the Jews, to 529 BC, when he died. Alternate translation: “throughout the rest of the reign of Cyrus as king of Persia” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	5	tq7w	figs-explicit	וְ⁠עַד־מַלְכ֖וּת דָּרְיָ֥וֶשׁ מֶֽלֶךְ־פָּרָֽס	1		Darius did not succeed Cyrus directly, and so this means that the enemy opposition continued throughout the reigns of the successors of Cyrus, until Darius became king. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “and throughout the reign of his successors, until Darius became king of Persia.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	5	8y4b	translate-names	דָּרְיָ֥וֶשׁ	1		This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	6	o931	writing-background	 וּ⁠בְ⁠מַלְכוּת֙	1		<br><br>This word indicates that the sentence it introduces will provide some background information. You can translate it with the word or phrase in your language that is most similar in meaning and significance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])<br><br><br><br>
EZR	4	6	zxv3	figs-explicit	 וּ⁠בְ⁠מַלְכוּת֙ אֲחַשְׁוֵר֔וֹשׁ בִּ⁠תְחִלַּ֖ת מַלְכוּת֑⁠וֹ	1		Ahasuerus actually ruled the Persian Empire after Darius, who was his father. So here the book is presenting some events out of chronological order. That is, it is telling about some things that happened later, before finishing the story of what happened at this time. In verse [24] (../04/24.md) the book will bring readers back to where it left off in verse [5] (../04/05.md), and then, in chapter [5] (../05/01.md), it will describe how work on rebuilding the temple did resume under the reign of Darius. But first it gives accounts here of how the enemies of the Jews continued to oppose them under two later kings, Ahasuerus (described in this verse) and Artaxerxes (described in verses [7–23] (../04/07.md)). The purpose may be to show that the Jews were wise to refuse the help that leaders from other nations offered, as described in verses [1–3] (../04/01.md). Since those leaders were actually enemies of the Jews, as they demonstrated by opposing them under one king after another, their offer was not sincere and they could not be trusted. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “In fact, they continued to oppose them under later kings. As soon as Ahasuerus succeeded his father Darius as king …” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	6	k3fy	translate-names	אֲחַשְׁוֵר֔וֹשׁ	1		This is the name of a man. He is better known as Xerxes, so you could use that name for him in your translation if it would be clearer for your readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	6	iaw6	figs-explicit	כָּתְב֣וּ שִׂטְנָ֔ה עַל־יֹשְׁבֵ֥י יְהוּדָ֖ה וִ⁠ירוּשָׁלִָֽם	1	wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly what the enemies of the Jews accused them of doing. (The book provides the text of their letter in verses [11–16] (../04/11.md), but it might be helpful to provide a summary in advance.) Alternate translation: “they wrote a letter in which they accused the Jews who had returned to Judah and Jerusalem of wanting to revolt against the king and stop paying taxes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	6	z7sk	figs-abstractnouns	כָּתְב֣וּ שִׂטְנָ֔ה	1		The abstract noun “accusation” refers to what the enemies of the Jews said about them in the letter that they sent to the king. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this word with a verb such as “accuse.” Alternate translation: “they wrote a letter in which they accused” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	4	6	o4k9	figs-metonymy	כָּתְב֣וּ שִׂטְנָ֔ה	1		Another way to view this phrase is that the book is referring figuratively to the physical letter by reference to something associated with it, its content, that is, what the enemies of the Jews said about them in it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a concrete term that explains the meaning of the figurative expression. Alternate translation: “they wrote a letter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	4	6	kzu9		יֹשְׁבֵ֥י יְהוּדָ֖ה וִ⁠ירוּשָׁלִָֽם	1		In this context, this expression does not mean all the inhabitants of the province of Judah and the city of Jerusalem, whatever their nationality, but rather the Jews who returned from exile and settled in those places. Alternate translation: “the Jews who had returned from exile and settled in Judah and Jerusalem”
EZR	4	7	mmwa	grammar-connect-time-sequential	 וּ⁠בִ⁠ימֵ֣י	1		This word indicates that the events the story will now relate came after the event it has just described. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship by using a word such as “Then.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EZR	4	7	8drm	figs-idiom	וּ⁠בִ⁠ימֵ֣י אַרְתַּחְשַׁ֗שְׂתָּא	1		The term “days” is used figuratively here to refer a particular period of time. In this context, it means during the reign of the next Persian king, Artaxerxes, the son of Ahasuerus (Xerxes). Alternate translation: “during the reign of Artaxerxes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	7	55xb	figs-explicit	וּ⁠בִ⁠ימֵ֣י אַרְתַּחְשַׁ֗שְׂתָּא	1		If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain that Artaxerxes was the next king of Persia. Alternate translation: “during the reign of the next Persian king, Artaxerxes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	7	xw38	translate-names	אַרְתַּחְשַׁ֗שְׂתָּא	1		This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	7	x91s	translate-names	בִּשְׁלָ֜ם מִתְרְדָ֤ת טָֽבְאֵל֙	1	Bishlam…Mithredath…Tabeel	These are the names of three men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	7	zjhh		וּ⁠שְׁאָ֣ר כנותו	1		The term “companion” here describes someone who holds a similar position. Alternate translation: “his associates”
EZR	4	7	hdnj	writing-background	⁠כְתָב֙ הַֽ⁠נִּשְׁתְּוָ֔ן כָּת֥וּב אֲרָמִ֖ית וּ⁠מְתֻרְגָּ֥ם אֲרָמִֽית	1		This is background information that helps readers understand how these officials went about writing to the king. Aramaic was the official language for government correspondence within the Persian empire. These officials apparently spoke Samaritan, a language similar to Hebrew. So they had someone express their message for them in the Aramaic language. The term “translated” does not necessarily indicate that the officials first wrote out their letter in Samaritan, and then someone translated it into Aramaic for them. Instead, they may have told someone what they wanted to say, and that person composed the letter in Aramaic. Since Aramaic also used differently shaped letters from the ones that Hebrew and Samaritan used, that person wrote the letter using those characters. Alternate translation: “These officials arranged for someone to write their letter for them in the Aramaic script and language.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EZR	4	7	jl52	figs-activepassive	הַֽ⁠נִּשְׁתְּוָ֔ן כָּת֥וּב	1	the letter	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “These officials arranged for someone to write their letter for them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	4	7	ym9r	figs-explicit	וּ⁠מְתֻרְגָּ֥ם אֲרָמִֽית	1	translated	We might expect that logically this phrase would come before the previous one, “written in the Aramaic script,” since the letter had to be composed before it was written down. But in its present position at the end of this sentence, this phrase actually serves a larger purpose within the book. It signals readers that what follows, through [6:18] (../06/18.md), is itself written in Aramaic. Presumably the original readers, who were clearly expected to understand both languages, would have been alert to such a signal. (A long Aramaic section in the book of Daniel is introduced similarly: “Then the wise men spoke to the king in Aramaic,” Daniel 2:4.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	8	48m7	translate-names	רְח֣וּם	1		This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	8	z7be	figs-idiom	בְּעֵל־טְעֵ֗ם	1		This was Rehum’s official title. The expression likely means that he had the authority in that area to issue decrees on behalf of the king. The king actually tells him to do this in verse [21] (../04/21.md). Alternate translation: “the royal deputy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	8	uu3t	translate-names	וְ⁠שִׁמְשַׁי֙	1	Shimshai	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	8	hwq8	translate-unknown	סָֽפְרָ֔⁠א	1	Rehum	This was Shimshai’s official title. It does not mean that he merely handled correspondence and record-keeping for Rehum. Rather, historical sources suggest that a “scribe” such Shimshai had important administrative responsibilities and authority of his own. Alternate translation: “the state secretary” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EZR	4	8	l343	figs-metonymy	אִגְּרָ֥ה חֲדָ֖ה עַל־יְרוּשְׁלֶ֑ם	1		Here the book uses the term “Jerusalem” to refer figuratively, by association, to the Jews who lived in that city and, by extension, to their fellow Jews in the rest of the province of Judah. Alternate translation: “a letter against the Jews who had returned from exile” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	4	8	kv6z	figs-metonymy	כְּנֵֽמָא	1		This phrase would ordinarly indicate that a copy of the text of the letter comes next in the book. If that is the case, then verses [9] (../04/09.md) and [10] (../04/10.md) are a preamble to the letter that lists the names of the senders. Alternate translation: “Here is what they wrote to the king.”
EZR	4	9	kt23		אֱדַ֜יִן	1		This Aramaic term often introduces a new episode in a story. But since the book is not continuing the story here, but instead quoting a document that begins with a list of names, here the book may be using the term to introduce the document that it is quoting. If it would be clearer in your language, you could omit any translation of the term. Alternatively, you could use the term in your language that would customarily introduce a list of the senders of a letter or other document. Alternate translation: “From”<br>
EZR	4	9	stkq	figs-quotemarks	אֱדַ֜יִן	1		If this word is introducing a quotation from a document, but you choose not to translate it, you could use some other means to indicate that this is a quotation, such quotation marks or whatever other punctuation or convention your language commonly uses for that purpose. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	4	9	vvp8	translate-names	רְח֣וּם בְּעֵל־טְעֵ֗ם	1	Erech…Susa	This is the name of a man and his title. See how you translated them in verse [8] (../04/08.md). Alternate translation: “Rehum, the royal deputy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	9	shnl	translate-names	וְ⁠שִׁמְשַׁי֙ סָֽפְרָ֔⁠א	1		This is the name of a man and his title. See how you translated them in verse [8] (../04/08.md). Alternate translation: “Shimshai the state secretary” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	9	d33e	figs-idiom	וּ⁠שְׁאָ֖ר כְּנָוָתְ⁠ה֑וֹן דִּ֠ינָיֵ⁠א וַ⁠אֲפַרְסַתְכָיֵ֞⁠א טַרְפְּלָיֵ֣⁠א	1		As in verse [7] (../04/07.md), the term “companion” here indicates someone who holds a similar position. The other three terms describe the various positions that the other people held who joined in sending this letter. Alternate translation: “their associates, who were judges, rulers, and officials” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])<br><br><br><br>
EZR	4	9	28pa	translate-names	אֲפָֽרְסָיֵ֗⁠א אַרְכְּוָיֵ֤א בָבְלָיֵ⁠א֙ שֽׁוּשַׁנְכָיֵ֔⁠א ד⁠הוא עֵלְמָיֵֽ⁠א	1		These are the names of four people groups and an alternate name by which the last group was known. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

The writers seem to feel that they can speak on behalf of their entire people groups because they would agree with the concerns that they are expressing about the Jews. You could say this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “on behalf of the Persians, Erechites, Babylonians, and Susaites (that is, Elamites).” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	10	k64z		וּ⁠שְׁאָ֣ר אֻמַּיָּ֗⁠א דִּ֤י הַגְלִי֙ אָסְנַפַּר֙ רַבָּ֣⁠א וְ⁠יַקִּירָ֔⁠א וְ⁠הוֹתֵ֣ב הִמּ֔וֹ בְּ⁠קִרְיָ֖ה דִּ֣י שָׁמְרָ֑יִן וּ⁠שְׁאָ֥ר עֲבַֽר־נַהֲרָ֖⁠ה וּ⁠כְעֶֽנֶת	1		This could mean one of two things. (1) It could be referring to two sets of people groups: (a) some further groups that, like the four listed in verse [9] (../04/09.md), Ashurbanipal exiled to the region of Samaria, and (b) all the other groups that were then living in the province of Beyond-the-River, however they came to live there. This is the reading of ULT. Alternate translation: “and all the other people groups whom the great and noble Ashurbanipal exiled and settled in the cities of Samaria, and all the other people groups living in Beyond-the-River.” (2) It could be referring to one set of people groups, made up of all the other groups that, like the four listed in verse [9] (../04/09.md), Ashurbanipal moved to this area and resettled in the cities of Samaria and in other parts of the province. This is the reading of UST. Alternate translation: “and all the other people groups whom the great and noble Ashurbanipal exiled and settled in the cities of Samaria and the rest of Beyond-the-River.” Either way, the officials writing this letter feel that they can speak on behalf of those other groups, in addition to the groups they belong to personally.<br><br><br>
EZR	4	10	d6lu	translate-names	אָסְנַפַּר֙	1	Ashurbanipal	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	10	pu35	translate-names	עֲבַֽר־נַהֲרָ֖⁠ה	1	the Province Beyond the River	This is the name of one of the provinces of the Persian Empire. It occurs many times throughout the book, and it will be helpful to your readers if you translate it consistently each time.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	10	s4ki		וּ⁠כְעֶֽנֶת	1		This is an Aramaic expression that was used in the letters of this time to introduce the main business of the letter. In [4:11] (../04/11.md), [4:17] (../04/17.md), and [7:12] (../07/12.md), it comes at the beginning of a letter, right after opening conventions such as the names of the sender and recipient and greetings. In [5:17] (../05/17.md), it comes near the end of a letter, to introduce a request that the writers finally make in light of extensive background information that they provide up to that point. But here it introduces the letter itself, after a long preamble that lists the names of the senders and the groups on whose behalf they feel they can speak. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use that in your translation. Otherwise, you do not need to represent this expression.
EZR	4	11	a7sk	figs-aside	דְּנָה֙ פַּרְשֶׁ֣גֶן אִגַּרְתָּ֔⁠א דִּ֚י שְׁלַ֣חוּ עֲל֔וֹ⁠הִי	1	This is a copy	“They” means the men listed in verse [9] (../04/09.md). The book is interrupting its quotation after the preamble to make sure that readers know that the text of the letter itself will now follow. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-aside]])
EZR	4	11	lny4	figs-quotemarks	דְּנָה֙ פַּרְשֶׁ֣גֶן אִגַּרְתָּ֔⁠א דִּ֚י שְׁלַ֣חוּ עֲל֔וֹ⁠הִי	1		If you used quotation marks or some other punctuation or convention to indicate the beginning of the quotation at the start of verse [9] (../04/09.md), you should use the same means to indicate that there is a break in the quotation at the end of verse [10] (../04/10.md), and then show that the quotation resumes after this sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	4	11	v61f	translate-names	אַרְתַּחְשַׁ֖שְׂתְּא	1		This is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [4:7] (../04/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	11	n6mp	figs-123person	עַבְדָ֛י⁠ךְ אֱנָ֥שׁ עֲבַֽר־נַהֲרָ֖⁠ה	1	the Province Beyond the River	Here the officials identify themselves as the senders of this letter, and they refer to themselves in the third person as “your servants” in order to address the king as their superior with humility and respect. Alternate translation: “From: Your officials in the province of Beyond-the-River” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EZR	4	11	uupo	figs-idiom	עַבְדָ֛י⁠ךְ אֱנָ֥שׁ עֲבַֽר־נַהֲרָ֖⁠ה	1		In this context, “men” means “people,” so this phrase means “people who live in Beyond-the-River province.” But together with the preceding phrase “your servants,” it means specifically those who work for the king there, that is, his royal officials. Alternate translation: “your officials in the province of Beyond-the-River” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	11	a2bi		וּ⁠כְעֶֽנֶת	1		As in verse [10] (../04/10.md), this is an Aramaic expression that introduces the main business of a letter. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use that in your translation. Otherwise, you do not need to represent this expression.
EZR	4	12	bqu1	figs-123person	יְדִ֨יעַ֙ לֶהֱוֵ֣א לְ⁠מַלְכָּ֔⁠א	1		These officials address the king in the third person as a sign of respect. If it would be clearer in your language, you could indicate this respect by using an expression such as “O king.” Alternate translation: “We would like you to know, O king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EZR	4	12	0168	figs-activepassive	יְדִ֨יעַ֙ לֶהֱוֵ֣א לְ⁠מַלְכָּ֔⁠א	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who is doing the action. Alternate translation: “We would like you to know, O king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	4	12	alqa	figs-idiom	יְהוּדָיֵ֗⁠א דִּ֤י סְלִ֨קוּ֙ מִן־לְוָתָ֔⁠ךְ	1		As in several instances earlier in the book, here “went up” means “traveled from Babylon to Judah,” since that involves going from a river valley up into the mountains. The officials describe Babylon to the king as “near you” because it was relatively much closer to the Persian royal court and more distant from Samaria. Alternate translation: “the Jews who returned to Judah from Babylon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	12	ns5b		עֲלֶ֥י⁠נָא אֲת֖וֹ לִ⁠ירוּשְׁלֶ֑ם	1		Alternate translation: “have settled near us in Jerusalem”
EZR	4	12	fu8s	figs-metonymy	קִרְיְתָ֨⁠א מָֽרָדְתָּ֤⁠א ו⁠באישת⁠א	1	the rebellious and evil city	Here the officials are describing the inhabitants of Jerusalem figuratively by reference to something associated with them, the city where they live. The officials are not saying that the walls and buildings would be rebellious if they were rebuilt. Rather, they are saying that the people who have lived in this city have continually revolted against their foreign rulers. Alternate translation: “that city whose people are constantly rebelling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	4	12	kke9	figs-doublet	מָֽרָדְתָּ֤⁠א ו⁠באישת⁠א	1		These two words mean similar things. The officials use them together to emphasize their certainty that because the people of Jerusalem are so “evil” or wicked (in this context meaning rebellious against authority), they would revolt against Artaxerxes if they were able to rebuild and fortify their city. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these words into a single expression. Alternate translation: “constantly rebelling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EZR	4	12	jr26	figs-parallelism	 וְשׁוּרַיָּ֣א שַׁכְלִ֔ילוּ וְ⁠אֻשַּׁיָּ֖⁠א יַחִֽיטוּ	1	repairing the foundations	“Completing” here is a way of saying “building.” Several times in this section of Ezra, the text uses the two words “build and complete” together to mean that one thing, or it uses them as poetic parallels. (For example, “which a great king of Israel built and completed,” [5:11] (../05/11.md), “to build this house and to complete this structure,” [5:3] (../05/03.md).) The term “complete” by itself here seems similarly to have the meaning of “build.” “Repairing” could also mean “digging out.” Either way, this is a reference to preparing foundations so that buildings can be set up on them. So the officials are describing the project of restoring the city by referring to the work on two parallel parts of it, its walls and its buildings. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this without using a similar figure of speech. Alternate translation: “they are working throughout the city to restore it,” otherwise, “they are rebuilding the walls and preparing foundations for buildings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EZR	4	13	daq3		 כְּעַ֗ן	1		This word is similar to the expression “and now” in [4:10] (../04/10.md) and [4:11] (../04/11.md). Here it introduces an important point within the letter. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use that in your translation.
EZR	4	13	2kk4	figs-123person	יְדִ֨יעַ֙ לֶהֱוֵ֣א לְ⁠מַלְכָּ֔⁠א	1		As in verse [12] (../04/12.md), the officials address the king here in the third person as a sign of respect. If it would be clearer in your language, you could indicate this respect by using an expression such as “O king.” Alternate translation: “we would like you to know, O king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EZR	4	13	cd84	figs-activepassive	יְדִ֨יעַ֙ לֶהֱוֵ֣א לְ⁠מַלְכָּ֔⁠א	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who is doing the action. Alternate translation: “We would like you to know, O king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	4	13	1j7f	figs-parallelism	הֵ֣ן קִרְיְתָ֥⁠א דָךְ֙ תִּתְבְּנֵ֔א וְ⁠שׁוּרַיָּ֖⁠ה יִֽשְׁתַּכְלְל֑וּן	1		These two phrases mean similar things. (As noted in [4:12] (../04/12.md), “complete” is another way of saying “build” when the terms are paired like this.) Likely for emphasis, the officials say essentially the same thing twice, to create an ominous sense of threat. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “if they are able to rebuild that whole city” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase is actually stronger and more threatening, because the city walls could prevent Artaxerxes from reasserting his sovereignty by force. Alternate translation: “if they rebuild the city, and especially if they restore its protective walls” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EZR	4	13	wj57	figs-activepassive	הֵ֣ן קִרְיְתָ֥⁠א דָךְ֙ תִּתְבְּנֵ֔א וְ⁠שׁוּרַיָּ֖⁠ה יִֽשְׁתַּכְלְל֑וּן	1	if this city is built and the wall is completed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. “If the Jews are able to rebuild the city and restore its walls.” Alternate translation: (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	4	13	247o	figs-doublet	מִנְדָּֽה־בְל֤וֹ וַ⁠הֲלָךְ֙ לָ֣א יִנְתְּנ֔וּן	1		“Tax,” “tribute,” and “custom” mean similar things. The officials use the three terms together to emphasize that the king could lose all of his income from the Jews living in Jerusalem and the province of Judah. You do not need to represent all three words in your translation if that would might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation, as in UST: “they will stop paying any taxes” However, there is a slight difference between the three terms. While their exact meaning is uncertain, they may refer to things such as taxes based on a percentage of income, tribute money that subjects would pay on a per-person basis, and duty that they would pay on articles purchased for use or transported for sale. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could also translate these terms separately. Alternate translation: “they will no longer pay taxes, tribute, or duty.”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]]. A doublet can involve the use of more than two words.)
EZR	4	13	pgs2	figs-explicit	וְ⁠אַפְּתֹ֥ם מַלְכִ֖ים תְּהַנְזִֽק	1	the treasury of the king will suffer loss	The officials are writing to a king who is the sole ruler of his empire, but they may be using the plural “kings” here because previous kings had accumulated much of the royal treasures. The officials may also be suggesting implicitly that not only Artaxerxes, but also his successors, will get no further revenue from the Jews if Jerusalem is rebuilt and fortified. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “this will reduce the income of all Persian kings from now on” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	14	ye9h		 כְּעַ֗ן	1		As in [4:13] (../04/13.md), this word is similar to the expression “and now” in [4:10] (../04/10.md) and [4:11] (../04/11.md). Here it introduces another important point within the letter. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use that in your translation.
EZR	4	14	m7yw	figs-idiom	מְלַ֤ח הֵֽיכְלָ⁠א֙ מְלַ֔חְנָא	1	we have eaten the salt of the palace	This expression means that these officials are paid from the royal treasury. Alternate translation: “because we are paid from the royal treasury” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	14	85g9	figs-explicit	דִּֽי־מְלַ֤ח הֵֽיכְלָ⁠א֙ מְלַ֔חְנָא	1		The implication is that because these officials are paid from the royal treasury, they feel a loyalty and a sense of obligation to the king. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “we are paid from the royal treasury, and out of loyalty we want to look after your interests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	14	uggy	figs-123person	עַ֨ל־דְּנָ֔ה שְׁלַ֖חְנָא וְ⁠הוֹדַ֥עְנָא לְ⁠מַלְכָּֽ⁠א	1		The officials continue to address the king in the third person as a sign of respect. If it would be clearer in your language, you could indicate this respect by using an expression such as “O king.” Alternate translation: “and that is why we have written to you, O king, to let you know about this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EZR	4	15	mcvp	figs-123person	דִּ֡י יְבַקַּר֩ 	1		Here again the officials are addressing the king in the third person as a sign of respect. They are also making their suggestion very diplomatically so that they do not appear to be telling the king what to do. Alternate translation: “May we suggest that you search” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EZR	4	15	fujm	figs-idiom	בִּֽ⁠סְפַר־דָּכְרָ֨נַיָּ֜⁠א דִּ֣י אֲבָהָתָ֗⁠ךְ	1		Although “book” is singular, this expression actually refers to the collection of documents that Artaxerxes possessed that recorded events and decrees from the reigns of earlier kings. He responds in [4:19] (../04/19.md) that he had his court officials search in this collection. Verses [6:1–2] (../06/01.md) describe how Darius earlier made a similar search. Alternate translation: “the royal chronicles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	15	u1i3	bita-hq	בִּֽ⁠סְפַר־דָּכְרָ֨נַיָּ֜⁠א דִּ֣י אֲבָהָתָ֗⁠ךְ	1		“Fathers” here figuratively means “predecessors.” This would include some who were direct ancestors of Artaxerxes, including his father Ahasuerus (Xerxes) and grandfather Darius. But it also seems to include the Assyrian and Babylonian kings to whose empires the Persian kings were now the heirs. The revolts of Jerusalem that this search discovered, as reported in [4:19] (../04/19.md), were against the Babylonians. Indeed, Artaxerxes says that his officials investigated the matter back to “ancient days,” presumably back to the times of earlier empires. Alternate translation: “the chronicles of previous kings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	4	15	3vmc	figs-doublet	וּ֠⁠תְהַשְׁכַּח בִּ⁠סְפַ֣ר דָּכְרָנַיָּ⁠א֮ וְ⁠תִנְדַּע֒	1		“Discover” and “learn” mean similar things. The officials use the two words together to emphasize how certain it is that the chronicles will show that Jerusalem has always been rebellious. You do not need to repeat both words in your translation if that would make the meaning less clear for your readers. Alternate translation: “the chronicles will certainly confirm for you ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EZR	4	15	sa9b	figs-parallelism	דִּי֩ קִרְיְתָ֨⁠א דָ֜ךְ קִרְיָ֣א מָֽרָדָ֗א וּֽ⁠מְהַנְזְקַ֤ת מַלְכִין֙ וּ⁠מְדִנָ֔ן וְ⁠אֶשְׁתַּדּוּר֙ עָבְדִ֣ין בְּ⁠גַוַּ֔⁠הּ מִן־יוֹמָ֖ת עָלְמָ֑⁠א	1	a rebellious city	These two phrases mean similar things. The officials say essentially the same thing twice for emphasis. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “the people living in Jerusalem have constantly rebelled against their kings and governors and refused to pay tribute” However, there is a slight difference in meaning. The second phrase intensifies the first phrase, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. Alternate translation: “the people of Jerusalem have rebelled against emperors and governors and refused to pay tribute. In fact, that city has been a center of revolt for as long as anyone has known, and it will never change.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EZR	4	15	z1fu	figs-idiom	וּֽ⁠מְהַנְזְקַ֤ת	1		In light of the similar expression in [4:13] (../04/13.md), “the revenue of the kings will suffer harm,” this likely means that the people of Jerusalem have refused to pay tribute to foreign emperors. Alternate translation: “refused to pay tribute” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	15	iw58	figs-metonymy	וּ⁠מְדִנָ֔ן	1		Here “provinces” refers to the rulers of provinces, that is, governors. The officials are describing them figuratively by reference to something associated with them, the jurisdictions that they rule. Alternate translation: “governors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	4	15	au5i	figs-doublet	עַ֨ל־דְּנָ֔ה קִרְיְתָ֥⁠א דָ֖ךְ הָֽחָרְבַֽת	1	this city was destroyed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “Because the people of Jerusalem kept rebelling against them, the Babylonians finally came and destroyed that city.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	4	16	qw5y	figs-123person	מְהוֹדְעִ֤ין אֲנַ֨חְנָה֙ לְ⁠מַלְכָּ֔⁠א	1		These officials address the king in the third person as a sign of respect. If it would be clearer in your language, you could indicate this respect by using an expression such as “O king.” Alternate translation: “We would like you to know, O king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EZR	4	16	cr21		הֵ֣ן קִרְיְתָ֥⁠א דָךְ֙ תִּתְבְּנֵ֔א וְ⁠שׁוּרַיָּ֖⁠ה יִֽשְׁתַּכְלְל֑וּן	1	if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed	See how you translated this expression in [4:13] (../04/13.md). (It may be helpful to review the two notes there that discuss the parallelism and the passive form.)
EZR	4	16	n9kz	figs-explicit	לָ⁠קֳבֵ֣ל דְּנָ֔ה חֲלָק֙ בַּ⁠עֲבַ֣ר נַהֲרָ֔⁠א לָ֥א אִיתַ֖י לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	you will have no control	The implication is that if Jerusalem became a stronghold, not only would its people rebel against Artaxerxes, they would lead all of the surrounding peoples to do the same, and the Persian Empire would lose all of its territories west of the Euphrates. Alternate translation: “they would lead the entire province of Beyond-the-River to revolt against you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	16	keh5	figs-hyperbole	לָ⁠קֳבֵ֣ל דְּנָ֔ה חֲלָק֙ בַּ⁠עֲבַ֣ר נַהֲרָ֔⁠א לָ֥א אִיתַ֖י לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	the Province Beyond the River	The expression “no share for you” likely also has the implication that the king would receive no further tribute or other revenue from the entire province. This is an exaggeration for emphasis and rhetorical effect. Alternate translation: “they would lead the entire province of Beyond-the-River to revolt against you, and everyone there would stop paying tribute” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
EZR	4	17	u66e	translate-names	רְח֤וּם בְּעֵל־טְעֵם֙	1	Rehum	This is the name of a man and his title. See how you translated them in verse [8] (../04/08.md). Alternate translation: “Rehum, the royal deputy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	17	hja4	translate-names	וְ⁠שִׁמְשַׁ֣י סָֽפְרָ֔⁠א	1	Shimshai	This is the name of a man and his title. See how you translated them in verse [8] (../04/08.md). Alternate translation: “Shimshai the state secretary” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	4	17	qp5d	translate-names	וּ⁠שְׁאָר֙ כְּנָוָ֣תְ⁠ה֔וֹן דִּ֥י יָתְבִ֖ין בְּ⁠שָֽׁמְרָ֑יִן וּ⁠שְׁאָ֧ר עֲבַֽר־נַהֲרָ֛⁠ה	1	the Province Beyond the River	As in verse [10] (../04/10.md), this could mean one of two things. (1) It could be referring to groups: (a) the fellow officials of Rehum and Shimshai in the region of Samaria, and (b) the people groups living in the rest of the province of Beyond-the-River, however they came to live there. This is the reading of ULT. Alternate translation: “the rest of their fellow officials, and the people groups living in Beyond-the-River.” (2) It could be referring to one group, the fellow officials of Rehum and Shimshai in the region of Samaria and in other parts of the province. This is the reading of UST. Alternate translation: “the rest of their fellow officials in Samaria and in the rest of Beyond-the-River.” It would probably be clearest for your readers if you followed the same reading here as you did in verse [10] (../04/10.md), whether that of ULT or UST.
EZR	4	17	rsd2	figs-idiom	וּ⁠שְׁאָר֙ כְּנָוָ֣תְ⁠ה֔וֹן	1	the River	As in verses [7] (../04/07.md) and [9] (../04/09.md), the term “companion” here indicates someone who holds a similar position. Alternate translation: “the rest of their associates” or “the rest of their fellow officials” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	4	17	oyb4		שְׁלָ֖ם	1		This is a conventional greeting or good wish that senders often included at the beginning of a letter at this time. (It is the Aramaic term that corresponds to the Hebrew expression “Shalom.”) If your language has a similar expression that it uses for the same purpose, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “Greetings” or “I hope all is well with you”
EZR	4	17	is3z		וּ⁠כְעֶֽת	1		As in verses [10] (../04/10.md) and [11] (../04/11.md), this is an Aramaic expression that introduces the main business of a letter. Unless your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you do not need to represent it in your translation.
EZR	4	18	nata	figs-explicit	 נִשְׁתְּוָנָ֕⁠א דִּ֥י שְׁלַחְתּ֖וּן עֲלֶ֑י⁠נָא	1		The implication of the plural “us” is that the king and his royal officials have received this letter. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “We have received the letter that you sent us.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	18	sza5	figs-activepassive	מְפָרַ֥שׁ קֱרִ֖י קָדָמָֽ⁠י	1	the letter that you sent me has been translated and read	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “and my officials have carefully read it aloud in my presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	4	18	bbxs	figs-explicit	מְפָרַ֥שׁ קֱרִ֖י קָדָמָֽ⁠י	1		The implication is not that the king was unable to read, or unable to see, and so he needed someone to read things to him. Rather, in ancient times, writing was considered a way of conveying speech at a distance. In effect, the court officials who read this letter aloud to the king were doing so on behalf of the Samaritan officials who had sent the letter, as if they had been present themselves. So be sure that your translation does not convey or suggest the idea that the king was unable to read. Alternate translation: “and my officials have carefully read it out loud in my presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	19	bapj	grammar-connect-logic-result	וּ⁠מִנִּ⁠י֮	1		This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	4	19	h6w5	figs-activepassive	וּ⁠מִנִּ⁠י֮ שִׂ֣ים טְעֵם֒ וּ⁠בַקַּ֣רוּ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action.

EZR	4	19	rx6m	figs-explicit	 וּ⁠מִנִּ⁠י֮ שִׂ֣ים טְעֵם֒ וּ⁠בַקַּ֣רוּ	1		The implication is that the king ordered his officials to search in the royal chronicles to investigate the charges that Rehum, Shimshai, and the others had made against Jerusalem. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I commanded my officials to search in the royal chronicles and investigate your claims” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	19	kzrh	figs-parallelism	דִּ֚י קִרְיְתָ֣⁠א דָ֔ךְ...עַל־מַלְכִ֖ין מִֽתְנַשְּׂאָ֑ה וּ⁠מְרַ֥ד וְ⁠אֶשְׁתַּדּ֖וּר מִתְעֲבֶד־בַּֽ⁠הּ	1		These two phrases mean similar things. Artaxerxes says the same thing twice, in similar ways, for emphasis. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Instead, if it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “Jerusalem has continually been a center for revolts against rulers”<br>However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase intensifies the first by portraying Jerusalem not just as a city that has rebelled, but as a place where rebellions have repeatedly originated. Alternate translation: “Jerusalem has rebelled against the emperors that ruled it, and in fact that city has repeatedly been a base for revolts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])<br><br><br><br>
EZR	4	19	eq5y	figs-idiom	קִרְיְתָ֣⁠א דָ֔ךְ...עַל־מַלְכִ֖ין מִֽתְנַשְּׂאָ֑ה	1		“That city” means Jerusalem.

Artaxerxes uses the two terms together for emphasis, perhaps to acknowledge that the records have indeed confirmed what the officials alleged. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “and the city has repeatedly been a base for revolts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

Alternate translation: “These kings conquered other nations and made them pay tribute” or “These kings conquered other nations and made them pay taxes, tribute, and duty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

As in verses [13] (../04/13.md) and [14] (../04/14.md), it introduces an important point within a letter. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use that in your translation.
EZR	4	21	ie6i	figs-explicit	שִׂ֣ימוּ טְּעֵ֔ם לְ⁠בַטָּלָ֖א גֻּבְרַיָּ֣⁠א אִלֵּ֑ךְ	1	give a command	“These men” means the Jews. This is a reference back to the letter from the Samaritan officials, in which they speak of “the Jews who went up from near you” and who “have come to us at Jerusalem” (verse [12] (../04/12.md)). The implication is that the Jews are to stop rebuilding the walls and buildings in Jerusalem. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Issue a decree to make those Jews who returned from exile to Jerusalem stop rebuilding the walls and buildings in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

He does not want there to be any rebuilding in Jerusalem unless he authorizes it personally. Alternate translation: “I want this decree to prevent all rebuilding unless I issue a decree permitting it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])

Alternate translation: “be sure to take action in response to this situation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

The implication is that if the Jews were able to rebuild and fortify Jerusalem and they revolted, then the interests of the king would be damaged because he would lose honor, as the officials suggest in their letter ([4:14] (../04/14.md)), and he would also lose revenue ([4:13] (../04/13.md), “the revenue of the kings will suffer harm”). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Why should I suffer dishonor or lose tribute money?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	4	22	t7e7	figs-rquestion	לְ⁠מָה֙ יִשְׂגֵּ֣א חֲבָלָ֔⁠א לְ⁠הַנְזָקַ֖ת מַלְכִֽין	1	Why should this damage increase, to the hurt of the kings?	Artaxerxes is making a statement, not asking a question. He does not expect the Samaritan officials to tell him why he should experience greater damage. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize how important it is for the officials to get the Jews to stop rebuilding Jerusalem. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “I must not suffer dishonor or lose tribute money.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EZR	4	22	kqp4	figs-123person	לְ⁠מָה֙ יִשְׂגֵּ֣א חֲבָלָ֔⁠א לְ⁠הַנְזָקַ֖ת מַלְכִֽין	1	this damage increase	As in [4:13] (../04/13.md), the plural “kings” here may envision that not just Artaxerxes but also his successors would lose revenue if Jerusalem leads a revolt that spreads throughout Beyond-the-River, as the Samaritan officials suggest it would. But Artaxerxes is speaking primarily of himself, in the third person, as kings sometimes did, just as their subjects addressed them in the third person to show humility and respect. (Compare, for example, the way Cyrus speaks of himself in the third person in [6:4] (../06/04.md), and Darius speaks of himself that way in [6:8] (../06/08.md) and [6:10] (../06/10.md)).

EZR	4	23	nhx0	grammar-connect-time-sequential	אֱדַ֗יִן	1	the copy of the letter from King Artaxerxes was read	This word indicates that the events the story will now relate came after the events it has just described.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning of the two words in a single phrase. Alternate translation: “they forcibly compelled them to stop” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
EZR	4	23	ck1l	bita-hq	וּ⁠בַטִּ֥לוּ הִמּ֖וֹ בְּ⁠אֶדְרָ֥ע וְ⁠חָֽיִל	1	Shimshai	“Arm” here is a figurative way of referring to a person’s power, influence, and capacity for action.

(If it would be helpful, review the note to [4:6] (../04/06.md). That note explains how the book tells of later events in [4:6–23] (../04/06.md) to show that the Jews were wise not to trust the Samaritans when they offered to help rebuild the temple during the reign of Cyrus, since they demonstrated by their repeated future opposition that they really were the enemies of the Jews.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say something explicitly here that would show how the book is returning to the time of Cyrus and his immediate successors. Alternate translation: “So that is how the enemies of the Jews tried under later kings to stop them from rebuilding Jerusalem. They attempted the same thing under Cyrus and his successors, and they were able to stop the work on the temple for a time.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If your language has a similar expression that it uses for the same purpose, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “Greetings” or “We hope all is well with you”
EZR	5	8	sp27	figs-123person	 יְדִ֣יעַ׀ לֶהֱוֵ֣א לְ⁠מַלְכָּ֗⁠א	0	General Information:	These officials address the king in the third person as a sign of respect. If it would be clearer in your language, you could indicate this respect by using an expression such as “O king.” Alternate translation: “We would like you to know, O king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

EZR	5	8	avmn	figs-metaphor	לְ⁠בֵית֙ אֱלָהָ֣⁠א רַבָּ֔⁠א	0	General Information:	This means the temple. The officials speak of it figuratively as if it were a place in which God would live. (They likely say “the great God” because the Jews told them, as they report in [5:11] (../05/11.md), that it would be a temple for the God who made heaven and earth.) Alternate translation: “the temple of the great God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

The book is quoting from the letter that Tattenai and his associates sent to King Darius, and within that letter, they are quoting what the Jewish elders told them in response to their question. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening secondary quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

However, in this context, the expression is also an idiom that indicates that this is the God whom they worship. Alternate translation: “We worship the God who created heaven and earth.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	5	11	35fg	figs-explicit	אֱלָ֨הּ שְׁמַיָּ֜⁠א וְ⁠אַרְעָ֗⁠א	1	We are servants of the God	The implications of this phrase are that God created heaven and earth and therefore rightfully rules over them.

EZR	5	11	a1ui	figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בָנַ֤יִן בַּיְתָ⁠א֙	1	that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and completed	“House” means the temple. This seems to be an abbreviated way of saying the “house of God,” a figurative description of the temple as the place where God lived. Alternate translation: “we are rebuilding the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

(Review the note about this at [4:12] (../04/12.md) if that would be helpful.) So the Jewish elders are expressing a single idea by using two words connected with “and.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning with a single word. Alternate translation: “which a great king of Israel constructed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
EZR	5	12	mnpe	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	 לָהֵ֗ן	1	completed	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces draws a contrast between what someone would hope and expect to happen after a great king built a temple for God and what actually happened. You could begin the sentence with a word such as “unfortunately” to indicate this contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

Rather, the elders are describing his armies figuratively by reference to something associated with them, the emperor who commanded them. Alternate translation: “God allowed the armies of Nebuchadnezzar to conquer them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	5	12	lfdn	translate-names	נְבוּכַדְנֶצַּ֥ר מֶֽלֶךְ־בָּבֶ֖ל	1	he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and deported the people	Nebuchadnezzar is the name of a man, and Babylon is the name of the empire that he ruled.

EZR	5	12	4oz8	figs-informremind	כַּסְדָּאָ֑ה	1	he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and deported the people	Here the elders provide some further background information about who Nebuchadnezzar was. Even though he was the ruler of the Babylonian Empire, he was not from the Babylonian people group himself, but rather from the Chaldean people group. Alternate translation: “who was from the Chaldean people group” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EZR	5	12	wqnc	translate-names	כַּסְדָּאָ֑ה	1	he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and deported the people	This is the name of a people group. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	5	12	sgt7		וּ⁠בַיְתָ֤⁠ה דְנָה֙ סַתְרֵ֔⁠הּ	1	destroyed this house	As in [5:11] (../05/11.md), “house” seems to be an abbreviated way of saying “house of God” or “temple.” Alternate translation: “Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the original temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	5	13	e3wn	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	בְּרַם֙	1	King Cyrus issued a command to rebuild the house of God	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces draws a contrast between the way Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the temple and the way Cyrus commanded it to be rebuilt. You could begin the sentence with a word such as “however” to indicate this contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EZR	5	13	fnbe	translate-ordinal	בִּ⁠שְׁנַ֣ת חֲדָ֔ה לְ⁠כ֥וֹרֶשׁ	1	King Cyrus issued a command to rebuild the house of God	The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, “one,” but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, “first,” in similar contexts elsewhere. If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of years, you can do that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “in the first year of Cyrus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EZR	5	13	16xc	translate-names	לְ⁠כ֥וֹרֶשׁ	1	King Cyrus issued a command to rebuild the house of God	This is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [1:1] (../01/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	5	13	g9o0	figs-explicit	מַלְכָּ֖⁠א דִּ֣י בָבֶ֑ל	1	King Cyrus issued a command to rebuild the house of God	Cyrus was the king of the Persian Empire, but since under his leadership the Persians had conquered the Babylonians, he also had the right to use the title “king of Babylon.” The implication may be that as the heir and successor to the throne of Babylon, Cyrus had the same power over the temple as Nebuchadnezzar, and so he could order it to be rebuilt. Alternate translation: “who conquered Babylon.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If it would be clearer in your language, you could break this sentence up in to three sentences. Alternate translation: “Nebuchadnezzar had taken the gold and silver objects that were used in worship out of the temple in Jerusalem. He had brought them to the temple in Babylon. King Cyrus took them out of the temple in Babylon and gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar.”
EZR	5	14	4kn9	translate-unknown	מָאנַיָּ֣⁠א דִֽי־בֵית־אֱלָהָ⁠א֮	0	General Information:	This means specifically the bowls, basins, and other objects listed in [1:9–10] (../01/09.md). These were used during worship in the temple. Alternate translation: “the objects that were used in worship in the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EZR	5	14	qsv0	figs-activepassive	וִ⁠יהִ֨יבוּ֙	0	General Information:	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “and Cyrus gave them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

EZR	5	15	pdri	figs-quotemarks	וַ⁠אֲמַר־לֵ֓⁠הּ׀	1	Let the house of God be rebuilt	This means, “Cyrus said to Sheshbazzar.” What follows in the rest of the verse is a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. The book is quoting from the letter that Tattenai and his associates sent to King Darius. Within that letter, they are quoting what the Jewish elders told them in response to their question. And within that response, the elders are quoting what King Cyrus told Sheshbazzar to do. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off the rest of the verse within tertiary quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	5	15	q6r3	figs-activepassive	וּ⁠בֵ֥ית אֱלָהָ֖⁠א יִתְבְּנֵ֥א עַל־אַתְרֵֽ⁠הּ	1	Let the house of God be rebuilt	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. “I authorize you to rebuild the temple on its original site” Alternate translation: (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

But this expression means something different. The elders use a different verb for the second element that means, after “not,” that the temple was only partially rebuilt, and then the work was interrupted. It would probably be helpful to your readers to show this difference in your translation. Alternate translation: “ever since then, we have been trying to rebuild the temple, but we still have much work to do on it.”
EZR	5	16	d7m8	figs-activepassive	מִתְבְּנֵ֖א וְ⁠לָ֥א שְׁלִֽם	1	it has been under construction, but is not complete	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action.

EZR	5	16	myr8	figs-quotemarks	 וְ⁠לָ֥א שְׁלִֽם	1	under construction	Here the letter ends its quotation of what the Jewish elders told Tattenai and his associates. If you decided in verse [11] (../05/11.md) to mark their words as a secondary quotation, you should indicate that ending here with a closing secondary quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	5	17	f4m4		 וּ⁠כְעַ֞ן	0	General Information:	As in [4:10] (../04/10.md) and [4:11] (../04/11.md), this is an Aramaic expression that introduces the main business of a letter. In this case, it comes near the end of the letter. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use that in your translation. Otherwise, you do not need to represent this phrase.
EZR	5	17	kviz	figs-idiom	הֵ֧ן עַל־מַלְכָּ֣⁠א טָ֗ב	1	let a search be made	This is an idiom that means, “If the king thinks this is a good idea” or “If this advice is acceptable to the king.” Alternate translation: “If it seems good to you, O king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	5	17	hlsk	figs-123person	הֵ֧ן עַל־מַלְכָּ֣⁠א טָ֗ב	1	let a search be made	Tattenai and his associates address the king in third person as a form of respect. Even if your language would conventionally use the second person in a context like this, you can indicate this respect by adding an expression such as “O king.” Alternate translation: “If it seems good to you, O king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EZR	5	17	abm5	figs-activepassive	יִ֠תְבַּקַּר	1	let a search be made	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “have your officials search” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

It is called a “house” [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]ically as if these documents “lived” there.

In reality, besides ruling over the former Assyrian Empire, Darius was also king of Persia. Persia had conquered Babylon, which had previously conquered Assyria. This made the king of Persia, the king of Assyria as well. It was unusual to refer to Darius as the king or ruler of Assyria. Ezra may have referred to him in this way to contrast Darius’ actions with those of the former rulers of Assyria, who had treated the Jews very cruelly. It was those earlier Assyrian rulers who had conquered the northern tribes of Israel and deported them to other lands. It was for this reasons that the northern tribes lost their identity and were no longer a distinct people group.

EZR	6	3	ev3b	translate-ordinal	בִּ⁠שְׁנַ֨ת חֲדָ֜ה לְ⁠כ֣וֹרֶשׁ מַלְכָּ֗⁠א	1	In the first year of King Cyrus	The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, “one,” but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, “first,” in similar contexts elsewhere. If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of years, you can do that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “in the first year of the reign of Cyrus as king of Persia” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

EZR	6	3	gi3x	figs-quotemarks	בַּיְתָ֣⁠א יִתְבְּנֵ֔א	1	Let the house be rebuilt	Starting here, and through [6:5] (../06/05.md), there is a quotation within a quotation. The book is quoting from the scroll that the officials found in Ecbatana, and within that scroll, the royal chronicles quote the decree of Cyrus. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening secondary quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation.

They are a poetic parallel, as in Isaiah 58:12, “Your ancient ruins will be built; you will raise up the foundations of many generations.” Cyrus says basically the same thing twice for emphasis and clarity. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “I authorize the Jews to raise up a new temple.” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase is more specific, in that it implicitly indicates that the new temple is to be built on the site of the former one. Alternate translation: “I authorize the Jews to rebuild the temple … on the site of the former temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

Alternate translation: “The temple is to be 90 feet high and 90 feet wide” or “The temple is to be 27 meters high and 27 meters wide” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])

They could mean that the walls of the temple should be three layers of stone thick, with a facing of wood on the inside. They could also mean that the walls should be built with one layer of wood on top of every three layers of stone, or that the temple was to have four stories, the lower three of stone and the top one of wood. Whatever the specifics, the implication is that the temple is to be rebuilt in the same way that Solomon originally built it, since 1 Kings 6:36 says that he built its inner court, at least, “with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I authorize the Jews to build this new temple out of wood and stone, just like the original one.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “I will pay the expenses from the royal revenue.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

If it would be clearer in your language, you could also break this sentence up in to three sentences. Alternate translation: “Nebuchadnezzar took the gold and silver objects that were used in worship out of the temple in Jerusalem. He brought them to Babylon. Return these objects to the Jews.”
EZR	6	5	5lhj	figs-activepassive	מָאנֵ֣י...יַהֲתִיב֗וּן	1	let the cost be paid by the king’s house	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, as an imperative.

EZR	6	5	bwim	translate-unknown	מָאנֵ֣י בֵית־אֱלָהָ⁠א֮	1	let the cost be paid by the king’s house	This means specifically the bowls, basins, and other objects listed in [1:9–10] (../01/09.md).

Cyrus is saying basically the same thing twice to emphasize how important it is for his officials to carry out this command. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “Make sure that you put each one of these objects back in the temple, right where it belongs.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

EZR	6	5	xrzz	figs-quotemarks	וְ⁠תַחֵ֖ת בְּ⁠בֵ֥ית אֱלָהָֽ⁠א	1	let the cost be paid by the king’s house	Here the text also ends its quotation from the scroll.

EZR	6	6	f9x5	figs-ellipsis	כְּעַ֡ן	0	General Information:	Here the book leaves out some of the material that a story would ordinarily need in order to be complete. It jumps right from its quotation from the scroll that was discovered at Ecbatana into the letter that King Darius wrote to Tattenai and his associates in response to what the scroll said. You could say this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “When King Darius learned from the scroll that Cyrus had ordered the temple to be rebuilt, he sent Tattenai and his associates a letter in answer to their inquiry. He told them what he had learned and then said, “Now …” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	6	6	ks97	figs-quotemarks	 כְּעַ֡ן	0	General Information:	Since the book here begins to quote the letter that King Darius sent in reply to Tattenai and his associates, it may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	6	6	wtim	figs-quotemarks	 כְּעַ֡ן	0	General Information:	As in [4:13] (../04/13.md), [4:14] (../04/14.md), and [4:21] (../04/21.md), this word introduces an important point within a letter. (It is similar to the expression “and now” in [4:10] (../04/10.md), [4:11] (../04/11.md), [4:17] (../04/17.md), and [5:17] (../05/17.md).) If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use that in your translation.

So it seems that the book is compressing the letter as it quotes it. Based on the other letters that the book quotes in [4:11–16] (../04/11.md), [4:17–22] (../04/17.md), and [5:7–17] (../05/17.md), the full letter probably said something like, “To Tattenai, the governor of Beyond-the-River, Shethar-Bozenai, and their companions, the officials who are in Beyond-the-River. Peace. And now,” followed by an explanation that the court officials had discovered a scroll that recorded the decree of Cyrus, and then instructions to these men, beginning “Now: Be far away from there!” But since the quotation from this letter in the book jumps from the list of the recipients’ names right to these instructions, if it would be clearer in your language, you could use the second person throughout. Alternate translation: “Tattenai, the governor of Beyond-the-River, Shethar-Bozenai, and your associates, you officials who are in Beyond-the-River: Be far away from there!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

The meaning is not simply that they are to stay away physically from that area, since they could still plot against the Jews from a distance (for example, by bribing officials in the royal court, as [4:5] (../04/05.md) describes). Alternate translation: “Do not interfere with what is happening in Jerusalem.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	6	7	k1ks	figs-parallelism	שְׁבֻ֕קוּ לַ⁠עֲבִידַ֖ת בֵּית־אֱלָהָ֣⁠א דֵ֑ךְ	1	the Province Beyond the River	This sentence means basically the same thing as the last sentence in verse [6] (../06/06.md). Darius says essentially the same thing twice for emphasis. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation for both sentences: “Do not interfere with the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase is more specific. It says precisely what Darius wants these Samaritan officials to leave alone. Alternate translation: “Do not interfere with what is happening in Jerusalem. Do not disturb the work on the temple there.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EZR	6	7	8w40		בֵּית־אֱלָהָ֥⁠א דֵ֖ךְ יִבְנ֥וֹן עַל־אַתְרֵֽ⁠הּ	1	the Province Beyond the River	As in [5:15] (../05/15.md), this expression means “rebuild the temple on its original site.” You could say that as an alternate translation.

EZR	6	8	xfsc	figs-litotes	דִּי־לָ֥א לְ⁠בַטָּלָֽא	1	at the expense of the king’s taxes beyond the River	“It” here means the work of rebuilding the temple. Darius is using a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “in order to make sure that the rebuilding is completed successfully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
EZR	6	8	5olo		דִּי־לָ֥א לְ⁠בַטָּלָֽא	1	at the expense of the king’s taxes beyond the River	However, since the book uses the term “stop” when describing the opposition to the temple rebuilding in [4:21] (../04/21.md), [4:23] (../04/23.md), [4:24] (../04/24.md), and [5:5] (../05/05.md), you could also choose to use that term to show the connection.

This sentence continues into the next verse. If it would be clearer in your language, you could break it up in to four sentences, three in this verse and the last one in verse [10] (../06/10.md). You could also use active forms instead of the two passive forms and say who would do the action in each case. Alternate translation: “The priests who are in Jerusalem will tell you what they need. This may include young bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine, and oil.

If you decided to break that verse into three sentences, you can make this verse a fourth sentence of its own. If it would be clearer in your language, you also could use a term such as “that way” to indicate that Darius is explaining his purpose here. Alternate translation: “That way, the priests can continually offer sweet-smelling sacrifices to the God who rules in heaven heaven and pray that God will preserve my life and the life of my sons.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])

Alternate translation: “my sons” (2) “Sons” could figuratively mean “descendants,” and specifically those whom Darius hoped would succeed him on the throne. As the note to [4:15] (../04/15.md) explains, the Persian kings spoke of predecessor kings as their “fathers,” so they may also have spoken of successor kings as their “sons.” Alternate translation: “my successors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

His house must then be turned into a rubbish heap	This is an implicit reference to one form of capital punishment that the Persians used. Darius assumes that the officials know what he means. Anyone who violates his order is to be lifted up and impaled on a beam of wood from his own house. That is, one end of the beam is to be sharpened so that it will pass through the body of the offender, and he is to be suspended in the air on the beam.

The phrase echoes Jewish usage, which Darius may be following deliberately to show his respect for the God whose temple he wants to be rebuilt. The phrase indicates that Jerusalem is the place from which God chose to start making himself known throughout the world. Alternate translation: “may the God who began to make himself known from Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
EZR	6	12	2ajr	bita-hq	וֵֽ⁠אלָהָ֞⁠א דִּ֣י שַׁכִּ֧ן שְׁמֵ֣⁠הּ תַּמָּ֗ה יְמַגַּ֞ר	1	who extends their hand to change it, or to destroy	Here “name” is a figurative way of referring to the fame or reputation of a person. Their fame is described by something associated with it, how well known their name is and how people react to hearing it. Alternate translation: “may the God who began to make himself known from Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	6	12	jqt7	figs-idiom	יְמַגַּ֞ר	1	who extends their hand to change it, or to destroy	This is an idiom that means “destroy.” Alternate translation: “destroy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	6	12	e5ta	figs-idiom	כָּל־מֶ֤לֶךְ וְ⁠עַם֙ דִּ֣י׀ יִשְׁלַ֣ח יְדֵ֗⁠הּ	1	who extends their hand to change it, or to destroy	Here the expression “to stretch out a hand” means to seek to do harm. Alternate translation: “any king or people who, with harmful intent, attempts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	6	12	mn8y	figs-ellipsis	לְ⁠הַשְׁנָיָ֛ה לְ⁠חַבָּלָ֛ה בֵּית־אֱלָהָ֥⁠א דֵ֖ךְ	1	who extends their hand to change it, or to destroy	This could mean one of two things. (1) It could mean that no one is to alter or destroy the temple. Alternate translation: “to alter the design of that temple or destroy it” (2) It could mean that no one is to try to “change” the decree of Darius, in the sense of “disobey” or “defy,” as in the previous verse, so that they can destroy the temple rather than ensure that it is rebuilt. In that case, this letter would be leaving out out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “to disobey my decree and destroy that temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	6	12	y3sn	figs-informremind	דִּ֣י בִ⁠ירוּשְׁלֶ֑ם	1	to change it	Here Darius repeats some background information in order to be very explicit about what temple this decree applies to. Alternate translation: “in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])

Alternate translation: “I, King Darius, am issuing this decree. I command you to carry it out exactly and efficiently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	6	12	yf8s	translate-names	דָרְיָ֨וֶשׁ֙	1	to change it	This is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [4:5] (../04/05.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	6	12	a8x8	figs-quotemarks	אָסְפַּ֖רְנָא יִתְעֲבִֽד	1	to change it	Here the text ends its quotation from the letter that King Darius sent in reply to Tattenai and his associates. If you decided in verse [6] (../06/12.md) to mark his words as a quotation, you should indicate that ending here with a closing primary quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	6	13	x0id	grammar-connect-logic-result	אֱ֠דַיִן	1	Tattenai…Shethar-Bozenai	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the result of what the previous sentences described. Alternate translation: “In response” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “received the response of King Darius to their letter and immediately carried out exactly what he had ordered.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	6	14	pxrv	grammar-connect-logic-result	 וְ⁠שָׂבֵ֤י	1	Tattenai…Shethar-Bozenai	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the result of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders were able to rebuild the temple successfully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
EZR	6	14	mibx	figs-explicit	בִּ⁠נְבוּאַת֙ חַגַּ֣י נביא⁠ה וּ⁠זְכַרְיָ֖ה בַּר־עִדּ֑וֹא 	1	Tattenai…Shethar-Bozenai	As in [5:1] (../05/01.md), the implication is that these two men, as God’s messengers, encouraged the Jewish leaders to persevere in the project of rebuilding the temple. Alternate translation: “thanks to the encouragement that Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo gave them in messages from God.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	6	14	l5ag	translate-names	חַגַּ֣י	1	Tattenai…Shethar-Bozenai	This is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [5:1] (../05/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

EZR	6	14	s1jd	figs-hendiadys	וּ⁠בְנ֣וֹ וְ⁠שַׁכְלִ֗לוּ	1	Tattenai…Shethar-Bozenai	As in [5:11] (../05/11.md), the words “build” and “complete” connected with “and” express a single idea. In this section of the book, when the two words are used together, “completing” is another way of saying “building.” (Review the note about this at [4:12] (../04/12.md) if that would be helpful.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning with a single word. Alternate translation: “They were able to construct the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
EZR	6	14	777p	figs-explicit	וּ⁠בְנ֣וֹ וְ⁠שַׁכְלִ֗לוּ	1	Tattenai…Shethar-Bozenai	The implication is that what the Jewish leaders were “building and completing,” that is, constructing, was the temple. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “They were able to construct the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	6	14	mgzk	figs-metaphor	מִן־טַ֨עַם֙ אֱלָ֣הּ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	Tattenai…Shethar-Bozenai	Here the book speaks figuratively of the messages that God had sent through the prophets Haggai and Zechariah as a “decree” or command that God had issued to the Jewish leaders to rebuild the temple, like the ones that the Persian kings had issued. If it would be clearer in your language, you could describe these messages in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “just as the God of Israel had commanded them to do through the prophets” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	6	14	j4jr	figs-explicit	וּ⁠מִ⁠טְּעֵם֙ כּ֣וֹרֶשׁ וְ⁠דָרְיָ֔וֶשׁ וְ⁠אַרְתַּחְשַׁ֖שְׂתְּא מֶ֥לֶךְ פָּרָֽס	1	Tattenai…Shethar-Bozenai	Here the book assumes some knowledge on the part of readers, because by this point in time, only King Cyrus [(1:2–4)] (../01/02.md) and King Darius [(6:6–12)] (../06/06.md) had issued decrees for the Jerusalem temple to be rebuilt. Artaxerxes was the grandson of Darius, and he would not become king for another 50 years. Moreover, while the book anticipated the reign of Artaxerxes in [4:7–23] (../04/07.md), there it recounted how he ordered the temple rebuilding to stop. But the book is assuming that readers will know that Artaxerxes eventually did reverse himself and issue a decree for the maintenance of the Jerusalem temple. The book describes this in [7:12–26] (../07/12.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and just as King Cyrus and King Darius of Persia had decreed they should do. King Artaxerxes of Persia later decreed that they should maintain the temple.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	6	14	683b	figs-informremind	כּ֣וֹרֶשׁ וְ⁠דָרְיָ֔וֶשׁ וְ⁠אַרְתַּחְשַׁ֖שְׂתְּא מֶ֥לֶךְ פָּרָֽס	1	Tattenai…Shethar-Bozenai	Here the book repeats some background information to remind readers who these men were. The phrase “the king of Persia” applies to each of them. Alternate translation: “King Cyrus and King Darius of Persia … King Artaxerxes of Persia” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])

EZR	6	15	zqs3	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠שֵׁיצִיא֙	1	This house was completed	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	6	15	q4v5	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠שֵׁיצִיא֙ בַּיְתָ֣⁠ה דְנָ֔ה	1	This house was completed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action.

EZR	6	15	mz6f	figs-metaphor	בַּיְתָ֣⁠ה דְנָ֔ה	1	This house was completed	As in [5:3] (../05/03.md), “house” here is a figurative way of saying temple. Alternate translation: “this temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	6	15	c1qx	translate-ordinal	עַ֛ד י֥וֹם תְּלָתָ֖ה לִ⁠ירַ֣ח אֲדָ֑ר	1	the third day of the month of Adar	The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, “three,” but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, “third,” in similar contexts elsewhere. If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of days, you can do that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “by the third day of the month of Adar” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EZR	6	15	i2k0	translate-hebrewmonths	עַ֛ד י֥וֹם תְּלָתָ֖ה לִ⁠ירַ֣ח אֲדָ֑ר	1	the third day of the month of Adar	You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar. Alternate translation: “by the third day of the month of Adar” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
EZR	6	15	bhp9	translate-ordinal	שְׁנַת־שֵׁ֔ת לְ⁠מַלְכ֖וּת דָּרְיָ֥וֶשׁ מַלְכָּֽ⁠א	1	sixth year	The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, “six,” but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, “sixth,” in similar contexts elsewhere. If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of years, you can do that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “in the sixth year of the reign of Darius as king of Persia” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EZR	6	16	xnpw	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠עֲבַ֣דוּ	1	the rest of the children of the exile	This word indicates that the event the story will now relate came after the events it has just described. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship by using a word such as “then.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EZR	6	16	ajjz	bita-hq	בְנֵֽי־יִ֠שְׂרָאֵל	1	the rest of the children of the exile	“Sons” figuratively means “descendants.” Here the book envisions all of the Israelites as descendants of the patriarch Jacob, who was also known as Israel. The expression comprises the three groups that are listed next, the priests, Levites, and other Jews. Alternate translation: “the Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	6	16	cq1q	figs-idiom	וּ⁠שְׁאָ֣ר בְּנֵי־גָלוּתָ֗⁠א	1	the rest of the children of the exile	As indicated in [2:1](../02/01.md) and [8:35](../08/35.md), the phrase **the sons of the exile** refers specifically to the group of Jewish people who returned to the land of Judah from Babylon after King Nebuchadnezzar had conquered Jerusalem and has taken many Jews as captives to Babylon. Alternate translation: “the Jews who had returned from exile” or “the Jews who had returned to their homeland” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	6	16	z1u1	figs-abstractnouns	 וַ⁠עֲבַ֣דוּ...חֲנֻכַּ֛ת בֵּית־אֱלָהָ֥⁠א דְנָ֖ה בְּ⁠חֶדְוָֽה	1	the rest of the children of the exile	The abstract noun “dedication” refers to the way the Israelites conducted a special ceremony to set the temple apart as a place for the worship of Yahweh. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this word with a verb such as “dedicate.” Alternate translation: “joyfully dedicated this temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])<br>
EZR	6	17	iel9	figs-abstractnouns	 וְ⁠הַקְרִ֗בוּ לַ⁠חֲנֻכַּת֮ בֵּית־אֱלָהָ֣⁠א דְנָה֒	1	one hundred bulls…four hundred lambs	As in the previous sentence, the abstract noun “dedication” refers to the way the Israelites conducted a special ceremony. Once again you could translate the idea behind this word with a verb such as “dedicate.” Alternate translation: “As they dedicated this temple, they offered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	6	17	r49v	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַקְרִ֗בוּ...תּוֹרִ֣ין מְאָ֔ה דִּכְרִ֣ין מָאתַ֔יִן אִמְּרִ֖ין אַרְבַּ֣ע מְאָ֑ה וּ⁠צְפִירֵ֨י עִזִּ֜ין ל⁠חטיא...תְּרֵֽי־עֲשַׂ֔ר	1	one hundred bulls…four hundred lambs	The implication, as [6:9] (../06/09.md) indicates explicitly, is that the bulls, rams, and lambs were used for whole burnt offerings. If it would be helpful, review the note to [3:2] (../03/02.md) about what whole burnt offerings were and why they were offered. Alternate translation:  “they offered 100 bulls, 200 rams, and 400 lambs as whole burnt offerings and 12 male goats as a sin offering.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	6	17	j5b6	figs-idiom	וּ⁠צְפִירֵ֨י עִזִּ֜ין	1	one hundred bulls…four hundred lambs	A male goat is called a buck. So this expression, “male goats of goats,” means the same thing as “male goats” in [8:35] (../08/35.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	6	17	quwd	figs-explicit	וּ⁠צְפִירֵ֨י עִזִּ֜ין...תְּרֵֽי־עֲשַׂ֔ר לְ⁠מִנְיָ֖ן שִׁבְטֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	one hundred bulls…four hundred lambs	The book assumes that readers will know that there were twelve tribes in Israel, so the twelve goats could symbolically represent the entire nation. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “12 male goats …, one for each of the 12 tribes of Israel.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	6	18	r0gx	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠הֲקִ֨ימוּ	1	to their divisions	This word indicates that the event the story will now relate came after the event it has just described. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship by using a word such as “then.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EZR	6	18	zkjf	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠הֲקִ֨ימוּ כָהֲנַיָּ֜⁠א...וְ⁠לֵוָיֵ⁠א֙	1	to their divisions	Here “stand” is a figurative way of saying that a person has assumed the duties of their office. So to cause someone to stand is to appoint them to those duties and install them in that office. Alternate translation: “they appointed the priests and Levites to serve in the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	6	18	iix1	figs-explicit	כָהֲנַיָּ֜⁠א בִּ⁠פְלֻגָּתְ⁠ה֗וֹן וְ⁠לֵוָיֵ⁠א֙ בְּ⁠מַחְלְקָ֣תְ⁠ה֔וֹן	1	to their divisions	The book assumes that readers will know that these “divisions” and “sections” were groups of priests and Levites, respectively, that served in the temple for a week at a time. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “in groups for a week at a time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	6	18	ba06	figs-metaphor	עַל־עֲבִידַ֥ת אֱלָהָ֖⁠א דִּ֣י בִ⁠ירוּשְׁלֶ֑ם	1	to their divisions	Here the book describes God in a spatial [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] as if he lived in the city of Jerusalem. This is a figurative reference to the way God’s presence was in the temple in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “to lead the worship of God in the temple in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	6	18	vt19		כִּ⁠כְתָ֖ב סְפַ֥ר מֹשֶֽׁה	1	to their divisions	Alternate translation: “as it is written in the book of Moses” or “as God commanded in the Law of Moses”

(As verse [20] (../06/20.md) explains, because the priests and Levites had been assigned to their duties, festivals like this could be observed again.) Alternate translation: “As a result, the Jews who had returned from exile were able to celebrate Passover” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	6	19	iy2d	bita-hq	בְנֵי־הַ⁠גּוֹלָ֖ה	1	to their divisions	See how you translated this expression in verse [16] (../06/16.md). Alternate translation: “the Jews who had returned to their homeland” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	6	19	9fmy	translate-unknown	אֶת־הַ⁠פָּ֑סַח	1	to their divisions	Passover is the name of a religious festival that the Law of Moses commanded the Jews to celebrate every year to remember how God had rescued their ancestors from slavery in Egypt.

EZR	6	19	6w76	translate-ordinal	בְּ⁠אַרְבָּעָ֥ה עָשָׂ֖ר לַ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ הָ⁠רִאשֽׁוֹן	1	to their divisions	The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, “fourteen,” but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, “fourteenth,” in similar contexts elsewhere. If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of days, you can do that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “on the fourteenth day of the first month” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EZR	6	19	j6lm	translate-hebrewmonths	בְּ⁠אַרְבָּעָ֥ה עָשָׂ֖ר לַ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ הָ⁠רִאשֽׁוֹן	1	fourteenth day of the first month	You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to use the numbers of the Hebrew day and month. Alternate translation: “on the fourteenth day of the first month” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])

Since Adar is the last month in the Jewish calendar, this was only a few weeks after the temple was finished. The implication is that the Jewish leaders had been able to complete that work and install the priests and Levites in time to celebrate this festival. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “only a few weeks later, on the fourteenth day of the first month” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “every single one of the priests and Levites had purified himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “every single one … had purified himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])<br>
EZR	6	20	j34t	figs-metaphor	הִֽטַּהֲר֞וּ	1	purified themselves	Being pure figuratively represents being acceptable to God. Alternate translation: “performed a ceremony to show that they wanted to be acceptable to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	6	20	ryyj	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּשְׁחֲט֤וּ הַ⁠פֶּ֨סַח֙	1	purified themselves	The book assumes that readers will know that the Passover celebration included a special meal of lamb. The Israelites had slaughtered lambs to eat on the night before they left Egypt, and they had put the blood of the lambs on their doorframes so that God would “pass over” their houses and everyone inside would be safe. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “they slaughtered lambs for the special Passover meal.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

EZR	6	20	m6ql	bita-hq	וְ⁠לַ⁠אֲחֵי⁠הֶ֥ם הַ⁠כֹּהֲנִ֖ים	1	purified themselves	Here “brother” is a figurative way of saying “fellow priests,” although it is possible that this group included some of the biological brothers of the priests who slaughtered the lambs.

EZR	6	21	dpio	bita-hq	 וַ⁠יֹּאכְל֣וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the nations of the land	“Sons” here figuratively means “descendants.” The book is envisioning all of the Israelites as descendants of the patriarch Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “the Israelites ate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	6	21	zqei	figs-ellipsis	 וַ⁠יֹּאכְל֣וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the nations of the land	Here the book leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete.

(1) It could be referring to people from other nations who had converted and become Jews. Alternate translation: “and anyone from another nation who had abandoned their former practices and become a Jew and would now worship and obey Yahweh” (2) It could be referring to Israelites who had not been taken into exile, but who had adopted the customs and practices of the other people groups that had come to live in the former Jewish homeland. Alternate translation: “as well as Israelites who had not gone into exile, who had adopted foreign practices, but who would now join the returned exiles in worshipping and obeying Yahweh” (3) It might not be a reference to a distinct group, but rather a description of something additional that was true of the people in the first group who celebrated the Passover. This is the interpretation that UST follows. Alternate translation: “that is, all those returned exiles who resolved to reject foreign practices and worship and obey Yahweh.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]].)

Alternate translation: “everyone who refused to do the things that the other people groups living in the land did that made them unclean” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	6	21	alu2	figs-metaphor	מִ⁠טֻּמְאַ֥ת	1	the uncleanness of the nations of the land	Here “uncleanness” figuratively represents being unacceptable to God. Alternate translation: “the things that … made them unacceptable to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	6	21	slp3	figs-idiom	גּוֹיֵֽ־הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	the uncleanness of the nations of the land	Like “the people of the land” in [4:4] (../04/04.md), this expression refers to the non-Israelite people groups who were living in this area. (Review the note at [4:4] (../04/04.md) if that would be helpful.) Alternate translation: “the foreign people groups living nearby” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

EZR	6	21	mamh	figs-informremind	אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	to seek Yahweh	As in [4:1] (../04/01.md), this phrase provides further background information about who Yahweh is. In context, it helps distinguish Yahweh from the gods of the “nations of the land.” Alternate translation: “Yahweh, the God whom the people of Israel worshipped” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EZR	6	22	4k5t	grammar-connect-time-sequential	​ וַ⁠יַּֽעֲשׂ֧וּ	1	turned the heart of the king of Assyria	​This word indicates that the event the story will now relate came after the event it has just described.

The term “unleavened bread” refers to bread that is made without yeast or other leavening. When God freed the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, he told them to flee quickly without waiting for their bread to rise. Unleavened bread is served in the yearly Passover meal in remembrance of that time. For the next week after Passover, the Jews are not to eat any leavened bread as well. The beginning and end of that week are marked by special ceremonies. Alternate translation: “for the next seven days they joyfully celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Within this part of the sentence, the first phrase describes the results of what comes afterwards. If it would be clearer in your language, you could break the entire sentence into three sentences, and make the earlier part about the festival the third and last sentence. You also could show the connection by using a phrase such as “and so” before the third sentence. Alternate translation: “Yahweh had made King Darius of Persia favorable to the Jews so that he supported the rebuilding of the temple. This had made the people very happy. And so …” .” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

Turning the king’s heart towards the Jews figuratively means that Yahweh made him think and feel differently about the work of the temple. Alternate translation: “made King Darius of Persia favorable to the Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	6	22	x9ls		מֶֽלֶךְ־אַשּׁוּר֙	1	to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God	This phrase actually refers to Darius, the king of Persia. But since the Persian Empire was the heir to the Assyrian Empire, Darius could be addressed by this title as well. (See the note to [4:15] (../04/15.md) that explains that the Persian kings considered their “fathers” or predecessor kings to include the Assyrian and Babylonian kings whose empires they had absorbed.) Alternate translation: “King Darius of Persia”
EZR	6	22	m7l7	figs-informremind​	אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	the work of the house of God	As in [4:1] (../04/01.md), this phrase provides further background information about who Yahweh is.

EZR	7	1	h549	​grammar-connect-time-sequential	וְ⁠אַחַר֙ הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֔לֶּה	0	General Information:	This phrase, common in Hebrew storytelling, indicates that the book will now relate events that came some time after the events it has described to this point. (Nearly sixty years went by between the sixth year of the reign of Darius, when the Jews finished rebuilding the temple, [6:15] (../06/15.md), and the seventh year of Artaxerxes, who was the grandson of Darius, when Ezra traveled to Jerusalem, [7:6] (../07/06.md).) If your language has a similar phrase that indicates this same thing, you can use that in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])

EZR	7	1	uerz	figs-explicit	​עֶזְרָא֙	0	General Information:	​In Ezra’s genealogy in [7:1–6] (../07/01.md), the book compresses about 30 generations, from Ezra back to Aaron, into a list of 16 ancestors. There is a symbolic significance behind the number of names chosen for the list, as this note will explain shortly. Moreover, three men on the list are included specifically because they had significant roles in the history of the worship of the Israelite community. Aaron [(7:5)] (../07/05.md) was the first high priest under the Law of Moses and the first to serve in the tabernacle. Azariah [(7:3)] (../07/03.md) was the first high priest to serve in the temple that Solomon built, which this book describes in [5:11] (../05/03.md). Seraiah [(7:1)] (../07/01.md) was the last high priest to serve in that temple. Unfortunately, the Babylonians executed him when they conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the temple. The rest of the names in the list are selected so that there will be seven generations between Aaron and Azariah, and seven generations between Azariah and Ezra, with Seraiah listed as the last generation before Ezra, even though he was Ezra’s great-grandfather. In the Bible, the number seven symbolically represents completeness. So this genealogy does not merely provide a partial list of the names of Ezra’s ancestors. Rather, it depicts his coming to Jerusalem as another definitive moment in the worship life of the Israelite community, comparable to the inauguration of worship in the tabernacle in the wilderness under Moses and in the Jerusalem temple under Solomon. If you have the freedom to use formatting creatively in your translation, you could make the implicit information about Aaron, Azariah, and Seraiah explicit and format this genealogy in a way that will highlight its purpose and design. Alternate translation and formatting:  <br>  <br>Ezra—  <br>  <br>the descendant of Seraiah, the last high priest in Solomon’s temple,  <br>the son of Azariah,  <br>the son of Hilkiah,  <br>the son of Shallum,  <br>the son of Zadok,  <br>the descendant of Ahitub,  <br>the descendant of Amariah,  <br>  <br>the son of Azariah, the high priest in Solomon’s temple,  <br>  <br>the descendant of Meraioth,  <br>the son of Zerahiah,  <br>the son of Uzzi,  <br>the son of Bukki,  <br>the son of Abishua,  <br>the son of Phinehas,  <br>the son of Eleazar,  <br>  <br>the son of Aaron, the first high priest in the tabernacle  <br>  <br>—this Ezra  <br>   <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

EZR	7	1	n9di	bita-hq	בֶּן־שְׂרָיָ֔ה בֶּן־עֲזַרְיָ֖ה בֶּן־חִלְקִיָּֽה	1	Seraiah	In general, in the list in verses [1–6] (../07/01.md), “son” figuratively means “descendant.” However, in many cases a man actually is the biological son of the next man on the list. So for your translation, you will need to decide whether to use the figurative expression “son,” which can also be literally true in many cases, or the non-figurative expression “descendant,” which is true in every case, or to say “son” for actual sons and “descendant” for descendants who are not actual sons. Choosing that last option would help show that the men on the list have been selected to make a certain number and arrangement, as explained in an earlier note. Alternative translations will illustrate this last option for each verse. Here, alternate translation: “the descendant of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

(The expression has a similar sense to the one in [5:5] (../05/05.md), “the eye of God was on the elders of the Jews.”) Alternate translation: “King Artaxerxes gave Ezra everything he asked for because Yahweh, his God, was helping him” or “King Artaxerxes gave Ezra everything he asked for because Yahweh, his God, was showing him favor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of years, you can do that here in your translation.

The “fifth month” means the fifth month in the Jewish calendar. You could convert the Hebrew month into an equivalent on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the equivalency will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to use the name or number of the Hebrew month.

EZR	7	9	k4wr	bita-hq	כְּ⁠יַד־אֱלֹהָ֖י⁠ו הַ⁠טּוֹבָ֥ה עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	according to the good hand of his God	As in [7:6] (../07/06.md), “hand” figuratively represents power and control, and the expression “the good hand of his God upon him” indicates that Ezra enjoyed God’s care, protection, and favor throughout this journey. Alternate translation: “because God was helping them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	7	10	lxrk	grammar-connect-logic-result	​כִּ֤י	1	Ezra had established his heart to seek	​This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the reasons for what the previous sentence described. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this in a fuller phrase. Alternate translation: “The reason why God blessed them was that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	7	10	b5p7	figs-metaphor	עֶזְרָא֙ הֵכִ֣ין לְבָב֔⁠וֹ	1	Ezra had established his heart to seek	Here the “heart” figuratively represents the thoughts and the will. Alternate translation: “Ezra had firmly determined” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 
EZR	7	10	y7yr	​figs-metaphor	לִ⁠דְר֛וֹשׁ אֶת־תּוֹרַ֥ת יְהוָ֖ה וְ⁠לַ⁠עֲשֹׂ֑ת	1	to observe	Just as in [6:21] (../06/21.md) to “seek” Yahweh figuratively means choosing to know, worship, and obey him, so here to “seek the law of Yahweh and to do it” means choosing to learn his law thoroughly in order to obey it, as a way of being loyal and obedient to Yahweh himself. Alternate translation: “to learn the law Yahweh thoroughly and obey it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	7	10	w9d8	figs-hendiadys​	וּ⁠לְ⁠לַמֵּ֥ד בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל חֹ֥ק וּ⁠מִשְׁפָּֽט	1	its statutes and ordinances	Here the book expresses a single idea by using two words connected with “and.” The words “statute” and “ordinance” both refer to commandments in the Law of Moses. The book uses the two words together to refer comprehensively to everything in the law. Alternate translation: “and to teach the people of Israel everything that the law commanded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
EZR	7	10	x92b	figs-personification	​בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	its statutes and ordinances	Here the story refers to all of the Israelites figuratively as if they were a single person, their ancestor, Israel. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
EZR	7	11	qjr1	​translate-names	הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ אַרְתַּחְשַׁ֔סְתְּא	1	This is a copy of the letter	Artaxerxes is the name of a man. It also occurs in verses [12] (../07/12.md) and [21] (../07/21.md) in this chapter. See how you translated it in [4:7] (../04/07.md). Alternate translation: “King Artaxerxes of Persia” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Alternate translation: “Ezra, who was a priest and a scribe, and who had carefully studied everything that Yahweh had commanded the people of Israel to do in the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]]) 
EZR	7	11	w5oy	figs-doublet	​מִצְוֺת־יְהוָ֛ה וְ⁠חֻקָּ֖י⁠ו עַל־יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	This is a copy of the letter	​These two phrases mean similar things. The book uses them together to refer comprehensively to everything in the law. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would make the meaning less clear for your readers. Alternate translation: “everything that Yahweh had commanded the people of Israel to do in the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EZR	7	11	54s9	figs-personification	​יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	This is a copy of the letter	As in verse [10] (../07/10.md), the story refers here to all of the Israelites figuratively as if they were a single person, their ancestor, Israel.

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	7	12	y33a	figs-explicit	אַ֨רְתַּחְשַׁ֔סְתְּא מֶ֖לֶךְ מַלְכַיָּ֑⁠א	1	Artaxerxes, king of kings	Following the conventions of letter-writing at the time, Artaxerxes gives his name first, as the sender. “The king of kings” was a title, meaning that he was the greatest of kings, the king that other kings obeyed. Alternate translation: “The Great King Artaxerxes” or “Artaxerxes, the greatest king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	7	12	8fcw	writing-background	​לְ⁠עֶזְרָ֣א כָ֠הֲנָ⁠א סָפַ֨ר דָּתָ֜⁠א דִּֽי־אֱלָ֧הּ שְׁמַיָּ֛⁠א	1	Artaxerxes, king of kings	​As was also conventional, Artaxerxes gives Ezra’s name next, as the recipient. He also includes some background information that helps identify Ezra further. Alternate translation: “Ezra, a priest of the God who rules in heaven, who has studied his law carefully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]]) 
EZR	7	12	gwt9		​אֱלָ֧הּ שְׁמַיָּ֛⁠א	1	Artaxerxes, king of kings	​See how you translated this expression in [5:11] (../05/11.md). Alternate translation: “the God who rules in heaven”
EZR	7	12	al0q		​גְּמִ֖יר	1	Artaxerxes, king of kings	​As in [4:17] (../04/17.md) and [5:7] (../05/07.md), this is a conventional greeting or good wish that senders at this time often included at the beginning of a letter. If your language has a similar expression that it uses for the same purpose, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “Greetings” or “We hope all is well with you”
EZR	7	12	0f52		​וּ⁠כְעֶֽנֶת	1	Artaxerxes, king of kings	This is an Aramaic expression that was used in the letters of this time to introduce the main business of the letter. If it would be helpful, review the note about this expression at [4:10] (../04/10.md). If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use that in your translation. Otherwise, you do not need to represent this expression.​
EZR	7	13	d9b4	​figs-activepassive	מִנִּ⁠י֮ שִׂ֣ים טְעֵם֒ דִּ֣י	1	I am issuing a decree that all those…who desire to go up to Jerusalem	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “I am commanding that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	7	13	wi2u	​figs-you	לִ⁠מְהָ֧ךְ לִֽ⁠ירוּשְׁלֶ֛ם עִמָּ֖⁠ךְ יְהָֽךְ	1	may go with you	The king is addressing Ezra, so “you” refers to him here, and “you” and “your” similarly refer to him in all of their other occurrences through verse [20] (../07/20.md). If your language distinguishes between forms of you, the form for a superior addressing a respected individual would be appropriate. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
EZR	7	13	g0ml		​מִן־עַמָּ֨⁠ה יִשְׂרָאֵ֜ל	1	may go with you	​Here Artaxerxes specifies that this is the name of Ezra’s people group, perhaps because he does not expect everyone who sees this letter to be familiar with them already. Alternate translation: “the people known as ‘Israel’”
EZR	7	14	cbf2	grammar-connect-logic-result	כָּ⁠ל־קֳבֵ֗ל דִּי֩	0	Connecting Statement:	This word indicates that in the long sentence that follows, the next several phrases (verses [14–16] (../07/14.md)) will provide the reasons for what the final two phrases say (in verse [17] (../07/17.md)). You can translate this first word with the word or phrase in your language that is most similar in meaning and significance. However, also consider the suggestion in the first note to [7:15] (../07/15.md) about breaking up this long sentence if that would make things clearer for your readers. If you follow that suggestion, you do not need to represent the word here in your translation. Alternate translation: “Since” or “In view of the fact that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	7	14	h7cx	figs-activepassive	מִן־קֳדָ֨ם מַלְכָּ֜⁠א וְ⁠שִׁבְעַ֤ת יָעֲטֹ֨⁠הִי֙ שְׁלִ֔יחַ	1	the king, and his seven counselors	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “I am my seven counselors are sending you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	7	14	1x02	figs-123person	מִן־קֳדָ֨ם מַלְכָּ֜⁠א...שְׁלִ֔יחַ	1	the king, and his seven counselors	Artaxerxes speaks of himself here in the third person. Alternate translation: “I … am sending you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EZR	7	14	tpvw	figs-metaphor	מִן־קֳדָ֨ם מַלְכָּ֜⁠א...שְׁלִ֔יחַ	1	the king, and his seven counselors	This could mean literally that Ezra has been in the king’s presence, that is, in his court, and that the king is sending him out from there. This phrase would show anyone who read the letter that Ezra was an important figure in the royal court. The phrase could also be a spatial [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] indicating that Ezra is going out on the king’s behalf and with his authority. Alternate translation: “I … am sending you from my court” or “I … am sending you with my authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	7	14	u9he	translate-unknown	וְ⁠שִׁבְעַ֤ת יָעֲטֹ֨⁠הִי֙	1	the king, and his seven counselors	As in [4:5] (../04/05.md), “counselors” means royal advisors in the Persian court. The seven mentioned here appear to have been the king’s closest and most important advisors. Alternate translation: “and his seven chief royal advisors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Alternate translation: “to see how carefully the Jews living in the province of Judah and the city of Jerusalem are following the law of your God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	7	14	v44t	figs-explicit	לְ⁠בַקָּרָ֥א עַל־יְה֖וּד וְ⁠לִֽ⁠ירוּשְׁלֶ֑ם בְּ⁠דָ֥ת אֱלָהָ֖⁠ךְ	1	to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God	The implication, particularly in light of the powers that the king gives Ezra at the end of the letter ([7:25–26] (../07/25.md)), is that “inquire” means more than just “find out about.” It also implies “do something about.” Alternate translation: “to make sure that the Jews living in the province of Judah and the city of Jerusalem follow the law of your God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	7	14	bwvo	bita-hq	דִּ֥י בִ⁠ידָֽ⁠ךְ	1	to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God	Here “hand” could mean two different things, and perhaps both are intended. (1) It could mean that Ezra was going to bring a written copy of the law of God with him. In that case “hand” would figuratively mean Ezra himself, by reference to something associated with bringing the law along, carrying it in the hand or using the hand to pack it. Alternate translation: “that you are bringing with you” (2) “Hand” could also be a [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] for power and authority, meaning that Ezra was to consider that the law of God gave him the authority to ensure that its commandments were followed. Alternate translation: “which will be the authority behind any measures you need to take” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could break up that sentence into several parts. You could make verse [14] (../07/14.md) a sentence of its own, and you could divide this verse into two sentences, one describing a reason and the other describing a result. Alternate translation: “My counselors and I have freely given silver and gold as offerings to the God of Israel. I am also sending you to deliver those gifts to his temple in Jerusalem.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	7	15	uu8a	figs-123person	מַלְכָּ֣⁠א	1	have freely offered	As in [7:14] (../07/14.md), Artaxerxes speaks of himself here in the third person. Alternate translation: “I” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EZR	7	15	qy1s	figs-personification	דִּ֥י בִֽ⁠ירוּשְׁלֶ֖ם מִשְׁכְּנֵֽ⁠הּ	1	have freely offered	Artaxerxes speaks of the God of Israel as if he actually lived in Jerusalem. Like Darius in [6:12] (../06/12.md), he seems to be echoing Jewish usage, likely to show his respect for the God of Israel. The phrase indicates that Jerusalem is the place from which God chose to start making himself known throughout the world. In this context it seems to refer specifically to the temple, since in the next verse Artaxerxes associates the silver and gold that he and his counselors have given with further gifts that others may give “for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.” Alternate translation: “whose temple is in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
EZR	7	16	j69i	figs-idiom	וְ⁠כֹל֙ כְּסַ֣ף וּ⁠דְהַ֔ב דִּ֣י תְהַשְׁכַּ֔ח בְּ⁠כֹ֖ל מְדִינַ֣ת בָּבֶ֑ל	1	the freewill offering of the people and the priests	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could also divide this verse into two sentences. This phrase could be the first sentence. “Find” is an idiom that in this context means “can obtain.” Artaxerxes is giving Ezra permission to invite everyone in the province of Babylon to contribute. Alternate translation: “I give you permission to ask everyone living in the province of Babylon to contribute silver and gold as well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	7	16	p3du	figs-explicit	וְ⁠כֹל֙ כְּסַ֣ף וּ⁠דְהַ֔ב דִּ֣י תְהַשְׁכַּ֔ח בְּ⁠כֹ֖ל מְדִינַ֣ת בָּבֶ֑ל	1	the freewill offering of the people and the priests	The implication is that these would be contributions towards the expenses of the worship of Yahweh in the temple in Jerusalem, just like the gifts described in the rest of the verse. The further implication is that just as the king and his counselors were sympathetic to the Jews in Jerusalem and eager to please the “God of heaven” ([7:23] (../07/23.md)), others in the province might be as well. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I authorize you to ask everyone living in the province of Babylon to contribute silver and gold towards the expenses of the worship of Yahweh in the temple in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	7	16	4pbi	figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠כֹ֖ל מְדִינַ֣ת בָּבֶ֑ל	1	the freewill offering of the people and the priests	Artaxerxes is describing the people who live in the province of Babylon figuratively, by reference to something associated with them, the province where they live. Alternate translation: “everyone living in the province of Babylon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	7	16	i0eg	translate-names	בָּבֶ֑ל	1	the freewill offering of the people and the priests	This is the name of one of the provinces in the Persian Empire. See how you translated it in [1:11] (../01/11.md). Review the note there if that would be helpful. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Here “the people” means the people of Israel, as in [7:13] (../07/13.md). Alternate translation: “I also authorize you to collect any offerings that the people of Israel and their priests want to give freely for the temple in Jerusalem”
EZR	7	16	pdnm	figs-informremind	 דִּ֥י בִ⁠ירוּשְׁלֶֽם	1	the freewill offering of the people and the priests	Like Darius in [6:12] (../06/12.md), here Artaxerxes repeats some background information in order to be very explicit about what temple his command applies to. Alternate translation: “in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EZR	7	17	pr2c	grammar-connect-logic-result	 כָּ⁠ל־קֳבֵ֣ל דְּנָה֩	0	Connecting Statement:	This word introduces the final part of the long sentence in verses [14–17] (../07/14.md). It indicates the results of the reasons that the sentence has given so far. You can translate it with the word or phrase in your language that is most similar in meaning and significance. However, if you have followed the suggestion to break this long sentence up into several shorter sentences, you do not need to represent the word here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	7	17	ciw6	figs-explicit	בְּ⁠כַסְפָּ֣⁠א דְנָ֗ה	0	Connecting Statement:	The implication is that this means not just the gifts from the priests and Israelites, but also the gifts from the king, his counselors, and the people of the province of Babylon. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this more explicitly. Alternate translation: “With all of this money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If it would be helpful, review the note to [3:2] (../03/02.md) about what whole burnt offerings were and why they were offered. The book also expects readers to know that the Law of Moses said that two further things should be offered together with the animals that were sacrificed in whole burnt offerings. One was a certain amount of flour mixed with oil, considered a “grain offering.” The other was a certain amount of wine, considered a “drink offering.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation:  “be sure to buy bulls, rams, and lambs to sacrifice as whole burnt offerings, and grain, oil, and wine for the grain offerings and drink offerings that the law says must accompany them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	7	17	sjnr		אָסְפַּ֨רְנָא	1	diligently buy bulls, rams, lambs, and grain offerings and drink offerings	In their decrees, as several examples in this book show, the Persian kings used this term “diligently” to mean carefully, exactly, and efficiently. Review the note to [5:8] (../05/08.md) about this term if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “be sure to”
EZR	7	18	a2bh	bita-hq	וּ⁠מָ֣ה דִי֩ עלי⁠ך וְ⁠עַל־אחי⁠ך יֵיטַ֗ב בִּ⁠שְׁאָ֛ר כַּסְפָּ֥⁠א וְ⁠דַהֲבָ֖⁠ה לְ⁠מֶעְבַּ֑ד כִּ⁠רְע֥וּת אֱלָהֲ⁠כֹ֖ם תַּעַבְדֽוּן	1	you and your brothers	Here “brother” is a figurative way of saying “fellow Israelites,” and in context it likely refers to the other Jewish leaders who would decide with Ezra what to do with the extra money. Alternate translation: “You and your fellow Jewish leaders can decide what you think your God would like you to do with any silver and gold that is left over.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	7	19	h5qf	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וּ⁠מָֽאנַיָּ⁠א֙	0	Connecting Statement:	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces draws a contrast, between what Ezra and the other Jewish leaders could do with gold and silver that people contributed in the form of money and what they had to do with gold and silver that people contributed in the form of bowls and other objects that could be used in the temple. You could begin the sentence with a word such as “however” to indicate this contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

The ones that people contributed on this occasion are described in more detail in [8:26–27] (../08/26.md). The implication in what the king says here is that Ezra and the Jewish leaders are not to sell or melt down these objects and use the proceeds to pay for temple expenses. Rather, they must use these objects only for temple worship. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “do not use objects that people contribute for use in the temple of your God to pay for the temple expenses. Make sure that you deliver every one of them to Jerusalem, where they can be used in God’s presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	7	19	yho1	figs-abstractnouns	 לְ⁠פָלְחָ֖ן בֵּ֣ית אֱלָהָ֑⁠ךְ	1	the objects that were given to you	The idea behind the abstract noun “service” can be expressed with a verb such as “use.” Alternate translation: “to use in the temple of your God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	7	19	bkk8	figs-idiom	הַשְׁלֵ֕ם	1	deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem	This Aramaic expression means to “make complete.” It is the same one that the Jewish leaders use in [5:16] (../05/16.md) when they say that the temple is not “finished” yet. In context it means that Ezra must be sure to deliver every single one of the contributed objects to the temple, so that the complete set that was donated will be reassembled there. (We see him doing this carefully in [8:26–27] (../08/26.md)). Alternate translation: “Make sure that you deliver every one of them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	7	19	a3tf	figs-metaphor	קֳדָ֖ם אֱלָ֥הּ יְרוּשְׁלֶֽם	1	for the service of the house of your God	In a spatial [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]], Artaxerxes says that Ezra must place the objects “in front of” God, figuratively meaning in God’s presence. Alternate translation: “to Jerusalem, where they can be used in God’s presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	7	19	wsrv	figs-metaphor	קֳדָ֖ם אֱלָ֥הּ יְרוּשְׁלֶֽם	1	for the service of the house of your God	As in [6:18] (../06/18.md), in another spatial [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]], Artaxerxes describes God as if he lived in the city of Jerusalem. This is a figurative reference to the way God’s presence was in the temple in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “to Jerusalem, where they can be used in God’s presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	7	20	tytf	figs-idiom	וּ⁠שְׁאָ֗ר חַשְׁחוּת֙ בֵּ֣ית אֱלָהָ֔⁠ךְ דִּ֥י יִפֶּל־לָ֖⁠ךְ לְ⁠מִנְתַּ֑ן	1	treasury	“That falls to you to give” is an idiom that means “that you have occasion to give,” in other words, “that you have to provide.” Alternate translation: “And anything else that you need to provide for the temple of your God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	7	20	4shw	figs-synecdoche	תִּנְתֵּ֕ן מִן־בֵּ֖ית גִּנְזֵ֥י מַלְכָּֽ⁠א	1	treasury	This does not mean, as in [5:17] (../05/17.md), the place where valuable royal documents were stored. Rather, as with the shorter expression “the treasures of the king” in [6:8] (../06/08.md), it means the royal treasury or the royal revenue. It is not necessarily a physical building. “House” likely represents all the wealth of the king figuratively. It is a [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] for “property,” meaning everything a person owns and keeps in their house, and by extension everything they own. Alternate translation: “I authorize you to pay for from my royal treasury” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Specifically, Artaxerxes has just said that Ezra may pay for additional expenses out of the royal treasury. Consequently, he will now give instructions about providing funds to Ezra to the officials responsible for administering the royal revenue in the province where Jerusalem is located. Alternate translation: “Consequently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

But now as he turns to address a new audience, the royal treasurers, he speaks of himself in the first person, and he uses the emphatic form “me myself” and repeats his name and title, as in verse [12] (../07/12.md). If you have been translating the king’s use of the third person for himself in this letter with the second person in your language, it may be helpful to your readers if you use some emphatic form or extended phrase here to show this transition.

He is describing how much he is authorizing Ezra to ask for from the treasury in money and supplies. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly, and you could also make this verse a sentence of its own. Alternate translation: “I am authorizing Ezra to ask you treasurers for up to 100 kikkars of silver, 100 cors of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of oil, and an unlimited amount of salt.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	7	22	c716	translate-bmoney	כְּסַף֮ כַּכְּרִ֣ין מְאָה֒	1	one hundred silver talents	You could try to express the modern value of this amount of silver. But since prices vary over time, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate. So you could express the amount instead using the ancient measurement, the kikkar, and explain in a note that this was equivalent to about 30 kilograms. Alternatively, you could specify the weight of the silver in the text, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

He means the Law of Moses, and specifically the commandments in the law for how community worship was to be conducted. Artaxerxes speaks of the law figuratively as if it were a royal decree that God had issued. Alternate translation: “everything that the God who rules in heaven has commanded regarding worship in his temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	7	23	t2e7	figs-metaphor	לְ⁠בֵ֖ית אֱלָ֣הּ שְׁמַיָּ֑⁠א	1	the house	See how you translated the expressions “the house of God” in [1:4] (../01/04.md) and “the God of heaven” in [5:11] (../05/11.md).

The king is making a statement, not really asking a question. He does not expect the treasurers to explain to him why there should be wrath against the kingdom. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize how important it is for the treasurers to ensure that sufficient funds are provided so that worship in the temple can be conducted just as God has commanded. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “I do not want God to be angry with me or with any of my descendants who rule after me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

The implication is that Artaxerxes wants to have God’s favor, and he is concerned that God will be displeased with him instead if he does not provide for God’s temple in Jerusalem. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I do not want God to be angry with me or with any of my descendants who rule after me because I neglected his temple.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

EZR	7	23	9ptx	figs-metonymy	מַלְכ֥וּת מַלְכָּ֖⁠א וּ⁠בְנֽוֹ⁠הִי	1	For why should his wrath come upon the kingdom of me and my sons	God would not actually be angry with the realm over which Artaxerxes has authority. Rather, he uses the term “kingdom” to describe himself and his descendants figuratively, by reference to something associated with them. Alternate translation: “me or any of my descendants who rule after me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	7	23	aia6	figs-123person	מַלְכָּ֖⁠א וּ⁠בְנֽוֹ⁠הִי	1	For why should his wrath come upon the kingdom of me and my sons	Artaxerxes speaks of himself here in the third person. Alternate translation: “me or any of my descendants who rule after me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EZR	7	23	wo5t	figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בְנֽוֹ⁠הִי	1	For why should his wrath come upon the kingdom of me and my sons	This could possibly mean the biological sons of King Artaxerxes, but since he speaks of the kingdom as belonging to them, it is more likely that this is a figurative reference to his descendants, and specifically the line of direct descendants who would rule Persia as his successors. (If it would be helpful, review the notes to [4:15] (../04/15.md) and [6:10] (../06/10.md) about how Persian kings considered their predecessors their “fathers” and their successors their “sons.”) Alternate translation: “my descendants who rule after me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

But here he uses the plural. This could possibly indicate “I and my seven chief royal counselors,” as in verse [15] (../07/15.md). However, since he spoke initially to these treasurers so individually and emphatically in verse [21] (../07/21.md), it seems unlikely that he would appeal to supporting authorities when giving these further instructions to them. Rather, it seems that the king speaks in the plural here because he has just envisioned himself within a succession of kings who will rule over this kingdom. (As the expression “the revenue of the kings” in [4:13] (../04/13.md) shows, the Persian emperors could envision their actions and decisions as embodying those of later kings.) So “we” most likely means “I,” and you could say that as an alternate translation. On the other hand, if you decide to say “we,” you should use the form that does not include the addressees, if you language makes that distinction. Alternate translation: “And I am informing you that you have no authority to collect taxes, tribute, or duty from” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
EZR	7	24	wx23		מִנְדָּ֤ה בְלוֹ֙ וַ⁠הֲלָ֔ךְ	1	We also make known to you that it is not lawful to impose tax, tribute, or custom	See how you translated this phrase in [4:13] (../04/13.md).

They all work in the temple of God. In this way, the phrase gives the reason why the treasurers may not impose taxes on anyone in any of these groups. Likely as a further way of supporting the temple, and perhaps also as a gesture of respect for God, Artaxerxes is providing an exemption from taxes for all temple personnel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could make this the first part of the sentence, since it gives the reason for the results that the rest of the sentence describes. Alternate translation: “Because the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and Nethinim all work in the temple of the God who rules in heaven, …” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

(1) “Hand” could figuratively represent power and control, in other words, capacity. Alternate translation: “since you have become wise by studying the ways of your God.” (2) The phrase could mean the same thing as “by the law of your God that is in your hand” at the beginning of the letter ([7:14] (../07/14.md)). There Artaxerxes told Ezra that he wanted him to make sure that the Jews living in the province of Judah and the city of Jerusalem were following God’s commandments. This could be a follow-up reference to those commandments, since Artaxerxes is about to give Ezra considerable powers to enforce them. Alternate translation: “following the law of your God, which will be your authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 
EZR	7	25	81rc	figs-abstractnouns	כְּ⁠חָכְמַ֨ת אֱלָהָ֤⁠ךְ	1	according to the wisdom of God that is in your hand, appoint judges and magistrates	As the previous note illustrates, the idea behind the abstract noun “wisdom” can be expressed either with a verbal phrase, “you have become wise,” or with a noun, “the law of your God.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

(1) The terms “arbiters” and “judges” mean similar things. Artaxerxes may be using the two words together to emphasize the authority that Ezra has to ensure that the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem follow God’s commandments. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “appoint judges so that they can judge” (2) Artaxerxes could also be using these two terms to refer to people in slightly different roles. The first term may refer to officials who decide disputes between people, and the second term may refer to officials who interpret the law and apply it to specific situations. This is the reading of UST. Alternate translation: “appoint officials who can decide disputes between people and officials who can interpret and apply the law.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

He is allowing the Jews there to have their own legal system, based on the Law of Moses. Alternate translation: “all the Jews living in Beyond-the-River province, who know the laws of your God”

Members of the Jewish community will not have to answer to Persian judges. Alternate translation: “The judges you appoint are diligently to punish anyone who refuses to obey the law of your God or my decrees.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Here he becomes the person telling the story, and he continues to tell it through to the end of chapter 9. In effect, the letter of introduction that King Artaxerxes wrote for him has been his introduction to us as well. The book does not say specifically that Ezra will now be the narrator, although one indication is that when Ezra is telling the story, he refers to himself as “I” and to the Jewish community as “us,” and another indication is that the book is now written in Hebrew again. But if it would be helpful to your readers, you could add a phrase to indicate this. Alternate translation: “When I, Ezra, received this letter from the king, I prayed, ‘Thank you, Yahweh, the God of our ancestors’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

If you decided to add a phrase to introduce him as the new narrator, you could use that same phrase to introduce this prayer as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “When I, Ezra, received this letter from the king, I prayed, ‘Thank you, Yahweh, the God of our ancestors’” Otherwise, you could show that this prayer is distinct from the story by setting it off with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. The quotation should end in the middle of verse [28] (../07/28.md), after “the mighty officials of the king.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-aside]])

EZR	7	27	w14w	figs-metaphor	לְ⁠פָאֵ֕ר אֶת־בֵּ֥ית יְהוָ֖ה	1	the house of Yahweh	This expression means to make something bright, glorious, or beautiful. Artaxerxes was not doing this literally, the way Cyrus and Darius did by supporting the physical rebuilding of the temple. Rather, Artaxerxes was making sure that the temple would always have everything it needed to keep operating. In that way he was making sure that the temple would not languish and be disrespected, but rather always be a vibrant place that was held in honor. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way like that. Alternate translation: “to honor the temple of Yahweh” or “to make sure that the temple of Yahweh would always be a vibrant place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

As in [3:11] (../03/11.md), “covenant faithfulness” refers specifically to Yahweh doing that for the people of Israel, in order to keep the promises he had made to them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this word with a verb such as “help.” Alternate translation: “and helped me get everything I needed from the king, as I was in his presence and in the presence of his counselors and mighty officials” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

The expression means that as Ezra stood before the king and his counselors and officials, Yahweh helped him get everything he needed from them. Alternate translation: “and helped me get everything I needed from the king, as I was in his presence and in the presence of his counselors and mighty officials” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	7	28	jzhp	figs-metaphor	הִטָּה־חֶ֗סֶד	1	who has extended covenant faithfulness to me	Ezra uses a spatial [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] to depict help figuratively stretching out to him from Yahweh. Alternate translation: “helped me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	7	28	pb8i	figs-quotemarks	שָׂרֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ הַ⁠גִּבֹּרִ֑ים	1	who has extended covenant faithfulness to me	This is the end of the prayer that Ezra prays as he begins to tell his own story. If you indicated the beginning of this prayer in verse [27] (../07/27.md) with an opening quotation mark or with the corresponding punctuation or convention in your language, you should use the same means to indicate the end of a quotation here.

Alternate translation: “I was encouraged because I recognized that Yahweh my God was helping me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

EZR	7	28	agha	figs-idiom	לַ⁠עֲל֥וֹת עִמִּֽ⁠י	1	as the hand of Yahweh my God was upon me	Ezra says “go up” because he and the group he was leading would have to travel from a river valley up into the mountains in order to return from their places of exile to Jerusalem.

(1) It could mean that Zechariah was the clan leader of the descendants of Shecaniah, and that they were all descendants of a more remote ancestor named Parosh. Alternate translation: “From the descendants of Shecaniah, who were descendants of Parosh, Zechariah.” (2) More likely, the phrase “from the sons of Shecaniah” applies to the end of the previous verse. 1 Chronicles 3:19–22 shows that Hattush was the grandson of Shecaniah, and that Shecaniah was either the grandson or a more distant descendant of Zerubbabel, who was a descendant of King David. (As several of the following verses show, further information like this may be provided about the clan leaders on this list.) So the end of verse [2] (../08/02.md) and the beginning of verse [3] (../08/03.md) could read, as an alternate translation: “From the descendants of King David, Hattush, one of the descendants of Shecaniah.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

From the descendants of Parosh, Zechariah” (The numbers refer to the options in the previous note.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

It seems that the name of the clan was accidentally left out at one point in the copying process. Other ancient versions of the Old Testament read, “from the sons of Zattu, Shecaniah the son of Jahaziel.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could treat that as the correct text.

So here the term “last” means “remaining.” A further implication is that the clan leader was now in Judah, so that the names provided are instead of family leaders who led this group on its return.

In verses [21] (../08/21.md) and [31] (../08/31.md), Ezra calls it the Ahava River, and you could use that same name here if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the Ahava River” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	8	15	cl4j	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	וָ⁠אָבִ֤ינָ⁠ה	1	Ahava	The word at the beginning of this phrase indicates that this event took place at the same time as the event the story has just related. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship in this case by using a phrase such as “while we were there.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
EZR	8	15	w7og	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אָבִ֤ינָ⁠ה בָ⁠עָם֙ וּ⁠בַ⁠כֹּ֣הֲנִ֔ים וּ⁠מִ⁠בְּנֵ֥י לֵוִ֖י לֹא־מָצָ֥אתִי שָֽׁם	1	Ahava	Here we learn that one purpose of this preliminary encampment was for Ezra to see whether he had all the temple personnel he needed. The implication behind this statement is that Ezra looked over the whole group to make sure that he did. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. (We learn in verse [25] (../08/25.md) that a further purpose of the encampment was to make arrangements for the safe transportation of the money and objects that had been donated for the temple.) Alternate translation: “I looked over the whole group and discovered that it consisted of lay people and priests, but there were no Levites among us.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	8	15	o9vg	bita-hq	וּ⁠מִ⁠בְּנֵ֥י לֵוִ֖י	1	Ahava	“Sons” here figuratively means “descendants.” The Levites were descendants of Levi. Alternate translation: “Levites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	8	16	ufp7	grammar-connect-logic-result	וָ⁠אֶשְׁלְחָ֡⁠ה	1	Shemaiah	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains what Ezra did as a result of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “as a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	8	16	9dmv	bita-hq	רָאשִׁ֑ים	1	Elnathan…Elnathan…Elnathan	Unlike in [7:28] (../07/28.md), here this expression does not mean “heads of father’s houses,” that is, “clan leaders.” Rather, “heads” here is simply a figurative way of saying “leader.” None of these nine men, with the possible exception of Zechariah, are among the clan leaders listed in verses [2–14] (../08/02.md). (And considering that three of the men whom Ezra summoned were named Elnathan, which shows that several individuals could share the same name, it’s quite possible that this is a different Zechariah from either the one named in verse [3] (../08/03.md) or the one named in verse [11] (../08/11.md).) Alternate translation: “who were all leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	8	16	l322	translate-names	וּ⁠לְ⁠יוֹיָרִ֥יב וּ⁠לְ⁠אֶלְנָתָ֖ן	1	Elnathan…Elnathan…Elnathan	Here Ezra lists the names of two more men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	8	16	tf03	figs-explicit	מְבִינִֽים	1	Elnathan…Elnathan…Elnathan	This phrase suggests that while Joiarib and Elnathan were not community leaders like the other nine men, Ezra sent them anyway to help recruit more temple personnel because they were wise and reasonable and could be persuasive. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “even though they were not leaders, because they were so wise” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	8	17	a4dg	figs-explicit	אוֹתָ⁠ם֙ עַל־אִדּ֣וֹ הָ⁠רֹ֔אשׁ בְּ⁠כָסִפְיָ֖א הַ⁠מָּק֑וֹם	1	Iddo	The implication, since Ezra is trying to recruit Levites, is that Iddo was the leader of the Levites in that place. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I sent them to a man named Iddo, who was the leader of the Levites at a place called Kasiphia” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	8	17	akq5	translate-names	אִדּ֣וֹ	1	Next I sent them	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	8	17	ggi9	translate-names	בְּ⁠כָסִפְיָ֖א	1	Kasiphia	This is the name of a place. Its exact location can no longer be identified. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Alternate translation: “I told them what to say to Iddo” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	8	17	y2wd	bita-hq	אִדּ֨וֹ אָחִ֤י⁠ו הַנְּתִינִים֙ בְּ⁠כָסִפְיָ֣א הַ⁠מָּק֔וֹם	1	I put in their mouths the words to speak to Iddo…to send to us servants for the house of our God	Here “brother” is a figurative way of referring to people who belonged to groups that could serve in the temple, as Iddo did. (It is possible that some of his biological brothers are included in this term.) In context, Iddo is a Levite leader, while the “brothers” are said to include Nethinim, that is, temple servants, so the term indicates both groups. Alternate translation: “Iddo and his fellow Levites and the Nethinim who were also living in Kasiphia” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	8	17	p5pg	figs-quotemarks	לְ⁠הָֽבִיא־לָ֥⁠נוּ מְשָׁרְתִ֖ים לְ⁠בֵ֥ית אֱלֹהֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	I put in their mouths the words to speak to Iddo…to send to us servants for the house of our God	This is the content of what Ezra told the men men to say to Iddo. If it would be clearer in your language, you could indicate that by translating these words as a direct quotation, setting them off with quotation marks and introducing them with a colon, or by using whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. Alternate translation: “Please send us some more people who can serve in the temple of our God.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	8	18	kbq4	grammar-connect-logic-result	 וַ⁠יָּבִ֨יאּוּ	1	Sherebiah…Mahli	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	8	18	a7cr	bita-hq	כְּ⁠יַד־אֱלֹהֵ֨י⁠נוּ הַ⁠טּוֹבָ֤ה עָלֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙	1	So they sent to us by the good hand of our God a man	As in the expression “according to the good hand of his God upon him” in [7:9] (../07/09.md), “hand” figuratively represents power and control, and the expression indicates that God showed Ezra favor and helped him on this occasion. Alternate translation: “because our God was helping us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	8	18	kue1	bita-hq	אִ֣ישׁ שֶׂ֔כֶל	1	a man of understanding	Here the ability to “see into” things figuratively means to have good judgment. Alternate translation: “decided” Alternate translation: “a very prudent man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 
EZR	8	18	o1sr	bita-hq	מִ⁠בְּנֵ֣י מַחְלִ֔י בֶּן־לֵוִ֖י בֶּן־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וְ⁠שֵׁרֵֽבְיָ֛ה	1	a man of understanding	“Sons” figuratively means “descendants” in reference to Mahli, since he was a distant ancestor of the group that Sherebiah belonged to. “Son” figuratively means “descendant” when applied to Levi, since Mahli was actually his grandson. But Levi actually was the biological son of Israel. Alternate translation: “named Sherebiah, one of the descendants of Mahli, the grandson of Levi, the son of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	8	18	d8n9	translate-names	מַחְלִ֔י...לֵוִ֖י...יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וְ⁠שֵׁרֵֽבְיָ֛ה	1	the son of Levi, the son of Israel	These are the names of four men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	8	18	pp9z	bita-hq	וּ⁠בָנָ֥י⁠ו וְ⁠אֶחָ֖י⁠ו שְׁמֹנָ֥ה עָשָֽׂר	1	eighteen	Since this was a small group of related people, it is quite possible that it consisted largely if not entirely of Sherebiah’s actual sons and brothers. So you could decide to treat the terms as literal in your translation. On the other hand, they could also be figurative, with “sons” meaning “descendants” and “brothers” meaning “relatives.” Alternate translation: “along with 18 of his sons and brothers” or “along with 18 of his descendants and relatives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	8	19	vsm6	bita-hq	וְ⁠אֶת־חֲשַׁבְיָ֔ה וְ⁠אִתּ֥⁠וֹ יְשַֽׁעְיָ֖ה מִ⁠בְּנֵ֣י מְרָרִ֑י	1	Hashabiah…Merari	“Sons” here figuratively means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “They also sent us Hashabiah and Jeshaiah, from the descendants of Merari” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	8	19	mf7n	translate-names	חֲשַׁבְיָ֔ה...יְשַֽׁעְיָ֖ה...מְרָרִ֑י	1	Jeshaiah	These are the names of three men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	8	19	bwf7	bita-hq	אֶחָ֥י⁠ו וּ⁠בְנֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1	twenty	This most likely means the brothers of Jeshaiah and the sonso of Jeshaiah and his brothers. Since, as in verse [18] (../08/18.md), this is a small group of related people, you could decide to treat the terms “brothers” and “sons” as either literal or figurative. Alternate translation: “along with his brothers and their sons” or “along with his relatives and their descendants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	8	20	f9pd	translate-names	נְתִינִ֖ים מָאתַ֣יִם וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֑ים	1	officials	See how you translated this term in [2:43] (../02/43.md). Review the explanation in the note there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “220 temple servants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

EZR	8	20	mi4i	figs-activepassive	כֻּלָּ֖⁠ם נִקְּב֥וּ בְ⁠שֵׁמֽוֹת	1	officials	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action.

EZR	8	21	bcl6	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וָ⁠אֶקְרָ֨א	1	the river Ahava	This word indicates that the event the story will now relate came after the event it has just described.

EZR	8	21	c4b8	translate-symaction	צוֹם֙...לְ⁠הִתְעַנּ֖וֹת	1	the river Ahava	The travelers would be afflicting themselves, that is, making themselves suffer, by denying themselves food. This was a gesture of humility and an expression that seeking God’s help was more important to them even than eating. Alternate translation: “a time of going without eating … to humble ourselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EZR	8	21	zh8n	translate-names	הַ⁠נָּהָ֣ר אַהֲוָ֔א	1	the river Ahava	See how you translated this name in [8:15] (../08/15.md). Alternate translation: “the Ahava River” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	8	21	4aiq	bita-hq	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י אֱלֹהֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1	the river Ahava	Here “face” figuratively represents the presence of a person. Alternate translation: “in the presence of our God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

A “straight way” figuratively represents safety during travel. Alternate translation: “to ask God to protect us, our children, and all our possessions while we traveled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	8	22	kq0z	grammar-connect-logic-result	 כִּ֣י	1	The hand of our God is on all those who seek him for good	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the reasons for what the previous sentence described.

EZR	8	22	i43j	grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּֽי	1	The hand of our God is on all those who seek him for good	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the reasons for what the previous sentence described.

You could show that connection by using a phrase such as “and so” after this sentence. Alternate translation: “We had told the king, ‘Our God protects everyone who obeys him, but he punishes everyone who refuses to serve him.’ And so …” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

Ezra is quoting what he and his fellow travelers had told King Artaxerxes. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off these words within quotation marks or by following whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	8	22	n4fd	bita-hq	יַד־אֱלֹהֵ֤י⁠נוּ עַל	1	The hand of our God is on all those who seek him for good	This expression has the same meaning as “the good hand of God” in [7:9] (../07/09.md) and [8:18] (../08/18.md). Here as well “hand” figuratively represents power and control. Alternate translation: “God protects” or “God helps” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	8	22	7dh2	figs-metaphor	כָּל־מְבַקְשָׁי⁠ו֙	1	The hand of our God is on all those who seek him for good	Seeking God is a [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] for worshipping, serving, and obeying him.

EZR	8	22	fb5x	figs-metonymy	וְ⁠עֻזּ֣⁠וֹ וְ⁠אַפּ֔⁠וֹ עַ֖ל	1	but his strength and his wrath are against all those who forsake him	God’s power and anger being on people is a metonym for him punishing them. Alternate translation: “but he punishes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	8	22	6p6t	bita-hq	וְ⁠עֻזּ֣⁠וֹ וְ⁠אַפּ֔⁠וֹ	1	but his strength and his wrath are against all those who forsake him	Here the nose figuratively represents anger.

EZR	8	22	xnzz	figs-hendiadys	וְ⁠עֻזּ֣⁠וֹ וְ⁠אַפּ֔⁠וֹ	1	but his strength and his wrath are against all those who forsake him	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with “and.” The word “nose,” a figure for anger, tells how God punishes. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “he wrathfully punishes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
EZR	8	22	s41q	figs-metaphor	כָּל־עֹזְבָֽי⁠ו	1	but his strength and his wrath are against all those who forsake him	Forsaking or abandoning God is a [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] for refusing to serve him.

EZR	8	23	42jm	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠נָּצ֛וּמָ⁠ה	1	So we fasted and sought God about this matter	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. Because Ezra was embarrassed to ask the king for protection, he and his fellow travelers earnestly prayed and fasted for God’s protection. Alternate translation: “For this reason” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	8	23	nfn4	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠נָּצ֛וּמָ⁠ה וַ⁠נְּבַקְשָׁ֥⁠ה מֵ⁠אֱלֹהֵ֖י⁠נוּ עַל־זֹ֑את וַ⁠יֵּעָתֵ֖ר לָֽ⁠נוּ	1	So we fasted and sought God about this matter	If it would be clearer in your language, you use an active form for the last phrase. Alternate translation: “we fasted and prayed to God about this, and he answered our prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	8	23	39a0	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יֵּעָתֵ֖ר לָֽ⁠נוּ	1	So we fasted and sought God about this matter	As is clear from the way this expression is used elsewhere in the Bible, it means that God answered a prayer. For example, in Genesis 25:21, “Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife because she could not have children, and Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.” However, since Ezra describes only in verse [32] (../08/32.md) how the group arrived safely in Jerusalem, the prayer had not yet been answered at this point. So an alternative meaning in context would be that the group received assurance that God would answer their prayer. Alternate translation: “he answered our prayer” or “we felt assured that he would answer our prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	8	24	u78j	grammar-connect-time-sequential	 וָ⁠אַבְדִּ֛ילָ⁠ה	1	Sherebiah, Hashabiah	This word indicates that the event the story will now relate came after the event it has just described.

So a mistake seems to have crept into the Hebrew text here. An ancient Greek version of the book of Ezra says “and” before Sherebiah, and that agrees with [8:30] (../08/30.md), which says that “the priests and the Levites” received the silver and gold and objects that Ezra weighed out to them. It will likely be clearest for your readers if you translate the verse that way. Alternate translation: “I selected 12 leaders of the priests, along with Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their fellow Levites.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
EZR	8	24	rvwg	figs-idiom	 וָ⁠אַבְדִּ֛ילָ⁠ה	1	Sherebiah, Hashabiah	This expression means to set someone or something apart for a special purpose or assignment. Alternate translation:  “I selected” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	8	24	v6yb	translate-names	לְ⁠שֵׁרֵֽבְיָ֣ה חֲשַׁבְיָ֔ה	1	Sherebiah, Hashabiah	These are the names of two men. See how you translated them in verses [18] (../08/18.md) and [19] (../08/19.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	8	24	6x71	bita-hq	מֵ⁠אֲחֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1	Sherebiah, Hashabiah	Here “brothers” is a figurative way of saying “fellow Levites,” although it is possible that some of the biological brothers of Sherebiah and Hashabiah were included in this group. Alternate translation: “their fellow Levites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

The value of the gold and silver objects would similarly have depended on their weight. Alternate translation: “I divided up the silver and gold and objects into 24 portions of equal value and gave one to each of the priests and Levites I had selected to transport them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
EZR	8	25	p4y8	figs-explicit	 ו⁠אשקול⁠ה לָ⁠הֶ֔ם אֶת־הַ⁠כֶּ֥סֶף וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠זָּהָ֖ב וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠כֵּלִ֑ים	1	Sherebiah, Hashabiah	The implication is that Ezra divided up the money and the objects into 24 portions of roughly equal value and assigned one portion to each priest and Levite to transport. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I divided up the silver and gold and objects into twenty-four portions of equal value and gave one to each of the priests and Levites I had selected to transport them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	8	25	vuis	figs-metaphor	תְּרוּמַ֣ת בֵּית־אֱלֹהֵ֗י⁠נוּ	1	Sherebiah, Hashabiah	Alternate translation: “the gifts for the temple of our God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	8	25	ke75	figs-explicit	וְ⁠כָל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל הַ⁠נִּמְצָאִֽים	1	Sherebiah, Hashabiah	The implication is that this means all the Israelites who living specifically in the province of Babylon, since Artaxerxes had authorized Ezra to invite contributions from people living throughout that province. Alternate translation: “all the Israelites who were living in the province of Babylon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	8	25	ptqo	figs-idiom	וְ⁠כָל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל הַ⁠נִּמְצָאִֽים	1	Sherebiah, Hashabiah	“Found” in this context is an idiom that means “could be found” or “were there.” Alternate translation: “all the Israelites who were living in the province of Babylon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	8	25	5lkw	figs-personification	וְ⁠כָל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	Sherebiah, Hashabiah	Here the story refers to all of the Israelites figuratively as if they were a single person, their ancestor, Israel. Alternate translation: “all the Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
EZR	8	26	u3bb	figs-metaphor	וָ⁠אֶשְׁקֲלָ֨⁠ה עַל־יָדָ֜⁠ם	1	650 talents of silver	While Ezra likely did place the money and the objects in the hands of the priests and Levites, “hand” here figuratively represents control and action. Alternate translation: “I entrusted to them for safe delivery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 
EZR	8	26	kxz7	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אֶשְׁקֲלָ֨⁠ה עַל־יָדָ֜⁠ם	1	650 talents of silver	The implication is that the list that follows is the total amount of money and objects that Ezra entrusted to the priests and Levites. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Here are the totals of the silver, gold, and objects that I entrusted to these priests and Levites for safe delivery.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Instead you could express the amount using the ancient measurement, the kikkar, and explain in a note that it was equivalent to about 30 kilograms. Alternatively, you could specify the weight of the silver in the text, as UST does. Alternate translation: “650 kikkars of silver, silver objects weighing 100 kikkars, 100 kikkars of gold” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
EZR	8	27	q2jm	translate-bmoney	וּ⁠כְפֹרֵ֤י זָהָב֙ עֶשְׂרִ֔ים לַ⁠אֲדַרְכֹנִ֖ים אָ֑לֶף	1	one thousand darics	1000 darics was the total value of the 20 bowls, not the value of each one. Here again you could express the amount using the ancient measurement, the daric, and explain in a note that it was equivalent to about 8 or 8.5 grams, or about a quarter of an ounce. Alternatively, you could specify the weight of the gold in the text, as UST does. Alternate translation: “20 golden bowls worth a total of 1000 darics” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
EZR	8	28	zlh5	grammar-connect-time-sequential	 וָ⁠אֹמְרָ֣⁠ה	1	vessels of bronze	This word indicates that the event the story will now relate came after the event it has just described. Ezra first weighed out the silver and gold and objects to the Levites, then he spoke the following words to them. In your translation, you can use the expression in your language that would best indicate this time sequence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EZR	8	28	rbg4	figs-quotemarks	וָ⁠אֹמְרָ֣⁠ה אֲלֵ⁠הֶ֗ם	1	Then I said to them	“Them” refers to the selected priests and Levites. In the rest of this verse and in verse [29] (../08/29.md), Ezra is quoting what he told them on this occasion. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off the words that follow with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	8	28	afyr	figs-idiom	אַתֶּ֥ם קֹ֨דֶשׁ֙ לַ⁠יהוָ֔ה וְ⁠הַ⁠כֵּלִ֖ים קֹ֑דֶשׁ	1	Then I said to them	“Holy” means “set apart for a special purpose.” Alternate translation: “I have selected you for a special mission. People donated these objects only to be used in the temple.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	8	28	w1c9	bita-hq	אֱלֹהֵ֥י אֲבֹתֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Then I said to them	“Fathers” here figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “the God of your ancestors” or “the God whom your ancestors worshipped” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	8	29	im6g	figs-ellipsis	שִׁקְד֣וּ וְ⁠שִׁמְר֗וּ	1	until you weigh them out before the heads of the priests and the Levites, and the heads of the fathers’ houses	Here Ezra leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. He is describing what the priests and Levites must do with the objects, silver, and gold that were devoted to Yahweh. You could indicate that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Take good care of those things, because their donors dedicated them to Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	8	29	z0lx	figs-hendiadys	שִׁקְד֣וּ וְ⁠שִׁמְר֗וּ	1	until you weigh them out before the heads of the priests and the Levites, and the heads of the fathers’ houses	These two words mean similar things. Ezra uses them together to emphasize how carefully the priests and Levites need to guard the silver and gold and objects. Alternate translation: “take good care of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
EZR	8	29	0txm	figs-explicit	עַֽד־תִּשְׁקְל֡וּ	1	until you weigh them out before the heads of the priests and the Levites, and the heads of the fathers’ houses	The implication is that when the priests and Levites arrived in Jerusalem, they would weigh out the silver, gold, and bronze to show the authorities there that they had not taken any of it for themselves. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “until you weigh them out, to prove that you have not stolen anything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	8	29	y29e	bita-hq	לִ⁠פְנֵי֩	1	until you weigh them out before the heads of the priests and the Levites, and the heads of the fathers’ houses	Here “face” figuratively represents the presence of a person. Alternate translation: “in the presence of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	8	29	n925	figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠שָׂרֵֽי־הָ⁠אָב֥וֹת לְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	until you weigh them out before the heads of the priests and the Levites, and the heads of the fathers’ houses	This seems to be another version of the expression “the heads of the fathers,” which is an abbreviated way of saying “the heads of father’s houses.” Review the note to [1:5] (../01/05.md) if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “the clan leaders of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	8	29	umrf	figs-ellipsis	הַ⁠לִּשְׁכ֖וֹת בֵּ֥ית יְהוָֽה	1	until you weigh them out before the heads of the priests and the Levites, and the heads of the fathers’ houses	The book assumes that readers will know that these “chambers” or rooms are specifically the storerooms in the temple, where money and objects for the temple worship were safely kept. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “in the storerooms of the temple of Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	8	29	1g88	figs-quotemarks	בֵּ֥ית יְהוָֽה	1	until you weigh them out before the heads of the priests and the Levites, and the heads of the fathers’ houses	This is the end of Ezra’s quotation of what he told the selected priests and Levites. If you decided in verse [28] (../08/28.md) to mark his words to them as a direct quotation, you should indicate the end of it here with a closing primary quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	8	30	ia74	grammar-connect-logic-result	 וְ⁠קִבְּלוּ֙	1	The priests and the Levites	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “In keeping with what Ezra told them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	8	30	ry58	figs-metonymy	מִשְׁקַ֛ל הַ⁠כֶּ֥סֶף וְ⁠הַ⁠זָּהָ֖ב וְ⁠הַ⁠כֵּלִ֑ים	1	The priests and the Levites	Here Ezra is describing the money and the objects figuratively by reference to something associated with them, their weight, which was what determined their value. Alternate translation: “the silver and the gold and the objects” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	8	30	1hiv	figs-idiom	הַ⁠כֹּהֲנִ֣ים וְ⁠הַ⁠לְוִיִּ֔ם מִשְׁקַ֛ל הַ⁠כֶּ֥סֶף וְ⁠הַ⁠זָּהָ֖ב וְ⁠הַ⁠כֵּלִ֑ים	1	The priests and the Levites	Ezra had already “weighed out” the silver and gold and objects to the priests and Levites (verses [26–27] (../08/26.md)), so “received” here does not mean that they took physical possession of them. Rather, it means that they accepted responsibility for them, in light of the charge that Ezra had just given. Alternate translation: “the priests and Levites accepted responsibility for the silver and the gold and the objects” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	8	31	c4v2	translate-names	וַֽ⁠נִּסְעָ֞⁠ה מִ⁠נְּהַ֣ר אַֽהֲוָ֗א	1	We went out from the river Ahava	See how you translated this name in [8:15] (../08/15.md). Alternate translation: “the Ahava River” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	8	31	ju8u	translate-hebrewmonths	בִּ⁠שְׁנֵ֤ים עָשָׂר֙ לַ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הָ⁠רִאשׁ֔וֹן	1	twelfth day of the first month	The “first month” means the first month in the Jewish calendar. You could convert the Hebrew month into an equivalent on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the equivalency will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to use the number of the Hebrew month. Alternate translation: “on the twelfth day of the first month of that year” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
EZR	8	31	c9im	translate-ordinal	בִּ⁠שְׁנֵ֤ים עָשָׂר֙ לַ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הָ⁠רִאשׁ֔וֹן	1	the river Ahava	The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, “twelve,” but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, “twelfth,” in similar contexts elsewhere. If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of days, you can do that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “on the twelfth day of the first month” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EZR	8	31	b7m1	bita-hq	וְ⁠יַד־אֱלֹהֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙ הָיְתָ֣ה עָלֵ֔י⁠נוּ	1	The hand of our God was on us	As in the expression “according to the good hand of our God upon us” in [8:18] (../08/18.md), “hand” here figuratively represents power and control. The expression indicates that God protected Ezra and the rest of the travelers on their journey. Alternate translation: “God protected us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Ezra essentially says the same thing twice to emphasize how carefully God protected this group that was transporting so much treasure. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “God protected us and prevented anyone from robbing us.” However, there is a slight difference in meaning. The first phrase is more general, and the second phrase describes more specifically how someone might have robbed the group. You could also choose to bring that difference out in your translation. Alternate translation: “God prevented anyone from attacking us, even though bandits lay in wait along the roadways” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EZR	8	31	6n0g	figs-metaphor	מִ⁠כַּ֥ף אוֹיֵ֛ב	1	he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from those lying in ambush along the road	“Palm” here is another way of saying “hand,” which figuratively represents strength and power. Alternate translation: “hostile attacks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 
EZR	8	31	pj64	figs-abstractnouns	⁠אוֹרֵ֖ב עַל־הַ⁠דָּֽרֶךְ	1	those lying in ambush	The abstract noun “ambush” refers to the way bandits will lie in wait along a roadside to rob travelers. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this word with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “bandits lie in wait along the roadside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	8	32	bhdp	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠נָּב֖וֹא	1	those lying in ambush	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. The group reached Jerusalem safely because God protected them. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	8	32	1agy	figs-explicit	וַ⁠נָּב֖וֹא יְרוּשָׁלִָ֑ם וַ⁠נֵּ֥שֶׁב שָׁ֖ם יָמִ֥ים שְׁלֹשָֽׁה	1	those lying in ambush	Ezra does not say specifically why the group waited for three days before delivering the silver and gold and objects to the temple. But the implication is that this gave them a chance to rest after their journey and arrange for the delivery. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “we reached Jerusalem safely, and after we got there, we rested for three days.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	8	33	p3qm	figs-activepassive	נִשְׁקַ֣ל הַ⁠כֶּסֶף֩ וְ⁠הַ⁠זָּהָ֨ב וְ⁠הַ⁠כֵּלִ֜ים	1	the silver and the gold and the objects were weighed out	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “each of the priests and Levites weighed out the silver and gold and objects they had transported” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) 
EZR	8	33	b9l2	figs-metaphor	 עַ֠ל יַד	1	the silver and the gold and the objects were weighed out…into the hand of Meremoth	As in [8:26] (../08/26.md), while the priests and Levites likely did place the money and the objects in the hands of the temple leaders, “hand” here figuratively represents control and action. Alternate translation: “and gave them into the custody of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 
EZR	8	33	lte3	translate-names	מְרֵמ֤וֹת בֶּן־אֽוּרִיָּה֙	1	Meremoth…Uriah…Eleazar…Phinehas…Jozabad…Jeshua…Noadiah…Binnui	Meremoth is the name of a man, and Uriah is the name of his father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	8	33	jb4h	translate-names	אֶלְעָזָ֣ר בֶּן־פִּֽינְחָ֑ס	1	Jeshua	Eleazar is the name of a man, and Phinehas is the name of his father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	8	33	vg4k	translate-names	יוֹזָבָ֧ד בֶּן־יֵשׁ֛וּעַ	1	Jeshua	Jozabad is the name of a man, and Jeshua is the name of his father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

EZR	8	34	4qb5	figs-explicit	בְּ⁠מִסְפָּ֥ר בְּ⁠מִשְׁקָ֖ל לַ⁠כֹּ֑ל	1	Jeshua	This means that the objects and the bars or coins of silver and gold were both counted and weighed. The implication is that this was a double confirmation of the honesty of the priests and Levites who had transported these donations. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Everything was both counted and weighed, as proof that the men who had carried it had not stolen anything.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	8	34	nh2n	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּכָּתֵ֥ב כָּֽל־הַ⁠מִּשְׁקָ֖ל	1	Jeshua	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action.

You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “the Jews who had returned from exile” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EZR	8	35	qo2t	figs-idiom	הַ֠⁠בָּאִים מֵֽ⁠הַ⁠שְּׁבִ֨י בְנֵֽי־הַ⁠גּוֹלָ֜ה	1	those who had come back from the captivity, the sons of the exiles	As indicated in [2:1](../02/01.md) and [8:35](../08/35.md), the phrase **the sons of the exile** refers specifically to the group of Jewish people who returned to the land of Judah from Babylon after King Nebuchadnezzar had conquered Jerusalem and has taken many Jews as captives to Babylon. Alternate translation: “the Jews who had returned from exile” or “the Jews who had returned to their homeland” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

In its first instance, it means a sacrifice offered in order to express a desire to be in good standing with God by creating an aroma, the smell of roasting meat, that was considered to be pleasing to God. This first instance of the expression applies to the bulls, rams, and lambs. As in [6:17] (../06/17.md), the goats were instead a “sin offering,” a sacrifice offered as an act of contrition and a request for forgiveness. “Burnt offering” in its second instance means a sacrifice that was entirely consumed, none of which anyone could eat. The bulls, rams, lambs, and goats were all burnt offerings in that second sense. Alternate translation: “offered as burnt offerings to the God of Israel 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, and 77 lambs, and as a sin offering 12 male goats. All of these sacrifices to Yahweh were completely burned up.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

There were 12 bulls “for all Israel” because there were twelve tribes of Israel. There were 12 goats for the same reason. The same symbolism seems to lie behind the 96 rams, since that number is eight times 12, although the significance of the number eight is no longer apparent. The number 77 is an intensive form of the number seven, which symbolizes completeness. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “offered 12 bulls, one for each of the tribes of Israel, 96 rams, eight for each of the tribes of Israel, and 77 lambs, expressing completeness, as burnt offerings to the God of Israel, and 12 male goats as a sin offering, one for each of the tribes of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “And Ezra and the Jewish leaders informed the royal officials and governors in Beyond-the-River province of the decrees that Artaxerxes had issued in his letter to Ezra.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “The group that had returned with Ezra supported the people of Judah and Jerusalem and the temple of God.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	intro	k1yz			0		# Ezra 09 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Intermarriage<br>When Ezra found out that many Jews had married Gentile wives, he prayed to God and asked God why he had been so good to them by letting these few people return from captivity even though they sinned by marrying Gentile wives. They did this before and God had punished them for it. God forbid this type of marriage because it caused the people to worship other gods. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])
EZR	9	1	ella	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וּ⁠כְ⁠כַלּ֣וֹת אֵ֗לֶּה	1	have not separated themselves	This phrase indicates that the events the story will now relate came right after the events it has just described.

EZR	9	1	on7w	figs-explicit	הַ⁠שָּׂרִים֙	1	have not separated themselves	These appear to be the same “leaders” as in [8:29] (../08/29.md), that is, clan leaders. But this is not a reference to all of them, since the ones who come to Ezra say that some of their fellow leaders have married foreign women. Alternate translation: “some of the clan leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	9	1	krhd	figs-quotemarks	נִגְּשׁ֨וּ אֵלַ֤⁠י...לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר	1	have not separated themselves	After this phrase Ezra begins to quote what these clan leaders told him.

EZR	9	1	kb76	figs-metaphor	לֹֽא־נִבְדְּל֞וּ...מֵ⁠עַמֵּ֖י הָ⁠אֲרָצ֑וֹת	1	have not separated themselves	Separation here is a spatial [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] for behavior. As in [6:21] (../06/21.md), it means to refuse to do the same things as another group. Alternate translation: “have not refused to do the things that the other people groups living in the land do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	1	6gdv	figs-idiom	מֵ⁠עַמֵּ֖י הָ⁠אֲרָצ֑וֹת כְּ֠⁠תוֹעֲבֹֽתֵי⁠הֶם	1	have not separated themselves	While the similar phrase in [6:21] (../06/21.md) spoke of “uncleanness,” that is, things that God does not accept, the phrase here speaks of “abominations,” that is, things that God cannot stand. Alternate translation: “the things that the other people groups living in the land do that God cannot stand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	1	30xi	figs-idiom	מֵ⁠עַמֵּ֖י הָ⁠אֲרָצ֑וֹת	1	have not separated themselves	See how you translated this expression in [3:3] (../03/03.md).

EZR	9	2	4rsp	figs-idiom	שְׂא֣וּ מִ⁠בְּנֹֽתֵי⁠הֶ֗ם לָ⁠הֶם֙ וְ⁠לִ⁠בְנֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1	have not separated themselves	“Lifted from their daughters” is an idiom that means “married some of their daughters.” Alternate translation: “Israelite men have married women from these other groups, and they have also gotten wives for their sons from those groups.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	2	iac7	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִתְעָֽרְבוּ֙ זֶ֣רַע הַ⁠קֹּ֔דֶשׁ בְּ⁠עַמֵּ֖י הָ⁠אֲרָצ֑וֹת	1	have not separated themselves	“Mixing” here is a [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] for blending one thing into another. Alternate translation: “they are blending the Jewish people right in with the other people groups living in the land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	2	mncx	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הִתְעָֽרְבוּ֙ זֶ֣רַע הַ⁠קֹּ֔דֶשׁ בְּ⁠עַמֵּ֖י הָ⁠אֲרָצ֑וֹת	1	have not separated themselves	The implication is that as a result of these marriages, not only was a distinct Jewish lineage being lost, the Jewish people were also beginning to follow the practices of these other groups rather than the commandments of God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they are blending the Jewish people right in with the other people groups living in the land, and they are starting to follow their practices rather than the law of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	9	2	fyoq	figs-idiom	זֶ֣רַע הַ⁠קֹּ֔דֶשׁ	1	have not separated themselves	As in [8:28] (../08/28.md), “holy” means “set apart for a special purpose.” Here the word refers specifically to the way God set apart the Israelites to be a model community of God’s followers. Alternate translation: “the Jewish people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	2	6k5m	figs-metaphor	זֶ֣רַע הַ⁠קֹּ֔דֶשׁ	1	have not separated themselves	Here “seed” is a [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] that means “offspring.” It is a comparison: Just as plants produce seeds that grow into many more plants, so people can have many offspring. The reference here is specifically to the offspring of Jacob, who also known as Israel, and specifically to his offspring who were living in Judah and Jerusalem, that is, the Jews who had returned from exile. Alternate translation: “the Jewish people” (See: Biblical Imagery - Plants and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	2	oxmn	figs-idiom	בְּ⁠עַמֵּ֖י הָ⁠אֲרָצ֑וֹת	1	have not separated themselves	As in verse [1] (../09/01.md), this expression refers to members of other people groups who were living in and around the province of Judah. Alternate translation: “the other people groups living in the land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	2	iie7	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠יַ֧ד הַ⁠שָּׂרִ֣ים וְ⁠הַ⁠סְּגָנִ֗ים הָֽיְתָ֛ה בַּ⁠מַּ֥עַל הַ⁠זֶּ֖ה רִאשׁוֹנָֽה	1	have not separated themselves	Here “hand” figuratively represents control and action. Alternate translation: “And our clan leaders and provincial officials were actually the first ones to disobey in this way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 
EZR	9	2	dwaf	figs-metaphor	בַּ⁠מַּ֥עַל הַ⁠זֶּ֖ה	1	have not separated themselves	Here “unfaithfulness” figuratively means disobedience. Alternate translation: “to disobey in this way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	2	vdhr	translate-unknown	הַ⁠סְּגָנִ֗ים	1	have not separated themselves	As in [4:9] (../04/09.md), this term applies to one kind of provincial official in the Persian Empire. Alternate translation: “provincial officials” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EZR	9	2	yn4s	figs-quotemarks	בַּ⁠מַּ֥עַל הַ⁠זֶּ֖ה	1	have not separated themselves	This is the end of Ezra’s quotation of what the clan leaders told him. If you decided in verse [1] (../09/01.md) to mark their words as a direct quotation, you should indicate that here with a closing primary quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	9	3	ck87	translate-symaction	קָרַ֥עְתִּי אֶת־בִּגְדִ֖⁠י וּ⁠מְעִילִ֑⁠י וָ⁠אֶמְרְטָ֞⁠ה מִ⁠שְּׂעַ֤ר רֹאשִׁ⁠י֙ וּ⁠זְקָנִ֔⁠י וָ⁠אֵשְׁבָ֖⁠ה מְשׁוֹמֵֽם	1	I tore my clothing and my robe and pulled out hair from my head and beard	By performing these actions, Ezra was demonstrating symbolically how serious a wrong the Israelites had committed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “To show how wrong it was for the Israelites to have married foreign women, I tore my tunic and my cloak, I pulled out some hair from my head and my beard, and I sat down stunned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EZR	9	3	qhy7		מְשׁוֹמֵֽם	1	When I heard this matter	The sense of this word is that Ezra was so overwhelmed with shock and horror that he did not move or speak. In your translation, you can use the expression in your language that would best indicate this. Alternate translation: “stunned”
EZR	9	4	k68j	figs-activepassive	 וְ⁠אֵלַ֣⁠י יֵאָסְפ֗וּ כֹּ֤ל חָרֵד֙ בְּ⁠דִבְרֵ֣י אֱלֹהֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל עַ֖ל מַ֣עַל הַ⁠גּוֹלָ֑ה	1	the evening sacrifice	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Everyone came and joined me who was just as distressed as I was about the way the Jews who had returned from exile had disobeyed the commandments of the God of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	9	4	0svq	figs-metaphor	כֹּ֤ל חָרֵד֙	1	the evening sacrifice	Often in the Old Testament “tremble” is a [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] meaning to regard someone or something with respect and reverential fear. That is likely included in the meaning here, but in this context, the expression also seems to indicate an actual physical response to the situation, just as Ezra did not move or speak. Alternate translation: “everyone … who was distressed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	4	adr0	figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠דִבְרֵ֣י אֱלֹהֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	the evening sacrifice	This phrase does not refer to something that God said on this occasion. Rather, it refers figuratively to the commandment that God had given to the Israelites earlier not to intermarry with foreign groups, which Ezra cites in his prayer in verses [10] (../09/10.md) and [11] (../09/11.md). Alternate translation: “the commandments of the God of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	4	sfvr	figs-metaphor	עַ֖ל מַ֣עַל הַ⁠גּוֹלָ֑ה	1	the evening sacrifice	The abstract noun “exiles” refers in this context to the Jews who had returned to their homeland from Babylon. Here “the exile” seems to be equivalent to the longer phrase “the sons of the exile” in several other places in the book. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “because of the way the Jews who had returned to their homeland had disobeyed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	9	4	9s46	figs-metaphor	עַ֖ל מַ֣עַל הַ⁠גּוֹלָ֑ה	1	the evening sacrifice	As in [9:2] (../09/02.md), “unfaithfulness” figuratively means disobedience. Alternate translation: “because of the way the Jews who had returned to their homeland had disobeyed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 
EZR	9	4	m8dw	translate-unknown	וַ⁠אֲנִי֙ יֹשֵׁ֣ב מְשׁוֹמֵ֔ם עַ֖ד לְ⁠מִנְחַ֥ת הָ⁠עָֽרֶב	1	the evening sacrifice	The “offering of the evening” was a sacrifice that the priests would offer around the time that the sun was going down. Alternate translation: “I continued to sit without moving or speaking until the time of the evening sacrifice” or “I continued to sit without moving or speaking for the rest of that day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EZR	9	5	v2nb	figs-idiom	קַ֚מְתִּי מִ⁠תַּֽעֲנִיתִ֔⁠י	1	my fasting	Even though Ezra had been sitting down and he now got up, in this context the word “arise” means more than that. As in [1:5] (../01/05.md), [3:2] (../03/02.md), and [5:2] (../05/02.md), it means to take action to get an enterprise under way. Ezra had been sitting motionless to show how ashamed and upset he was. Now he began to take action to address the situation the clan leaders had told him about. Alternate translation: “I stopped sitting motionless and began to do something about the situation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	5	4ygv	translate-symaction	מִ⁠תַּֽעֲנִיתִ֔⁠י וּ⁠בְ⁠קָרְעִ֥⁠י בִגְדִ֖⁠י וּ⁠מְעִילִ֑⁠י	1	my fasting	As the note to [9:3] (../09/03.md) explains, Ezra had torn his clothes to show how wrong it was for the Israelites to have married foreign women. By not changing out of his torn clothes, Ezra was continuing to show that symbolically. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “but I kept wearing my torn clothes to show how wrong it was for the Israelites to have married foreign women.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EZR	9	5	qye1	translate-symaction	וָֽ⁠אֶכְרְעָ⁠ה֙ עַל־בִּרְכַּ֔⁠י וָ⁠אֶפְרְשָׂ֥⁠ה כַפַּ֖⁠י אֶל־יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהָֽ⁠י	1	knelt down on my knees, and spread out my hands	These two physical gestures showed publicly that Ezra was going to pray.  Alternate translation: “I knelt down and spread out my hands in a gesture of prayer to Yahweh my God.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EZR	9	6	y5xu	figs-quotemarks	 וָ⁠אֹמְרָ֗⁠ה	1	our iniquities have risen higher than our head, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens	After this phrase Ezra begins to quote what he said out loud in prayer on this occasion. The quotation continues through verse [15] (../09/15.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	9	6	yz8d	figs-doublet	בֹּ֣שְׁתִּי וְ⁠נִכְלַ֔מְתִּי	1	our iniquities have risen higher than our head, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens	“Ashamed” and “disgraced” mean similar things. Ezra uses them together to emphasize how humiliated he feels by what the Israelites have done. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these terms into a single expression. Alternate translation: “deeply humiliated” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EZR	9	6	xiue	figs-metaphor	לְ⁠הָרִ֧ים...פָּנַ֖⁠י אֵלֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	our iniquities have risen higher than our head, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens	This means “to look at you directly” or “to look at you face to face,” and since Ezra could not do that literally with God, it is a figurative way of saying “to address you.” Alternate translation: “even to speak to you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	6	aca6	figs-parallelism	כִּ֣י עֲוֺנֹתֵ֤י⁠נוּ רָבוּ֙ לְ⁠מַ֣עְלָ⁠ה רֹּ֔אשׁ וְ⁠אַשְׁמָתֵ֥⁠נוּ גָדְלָ֖ה עַ֥ד לַ⁠שָּׁמָֽיִם	1	our iniquities have risen higher than our head, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens	These two phrases mean similar things. Ezra uses the repetition to emphasize how guilty the people of Israel are. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “We have committed such great sins that our guilt over them is overwhelming us” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The first phrase speaks of the effects of these sins on the Israelites, while the second phrase speaks of their effects on their standing with God. Alternate translation: “We have committed such great sins that they are overwhelming us, and we know that they are making us guilty before you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EZR	9	6	7xnk	grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּ֣י עֲוֺנֹתֵ֤י⁠נוּ רָבוּ֙ לְ⁠מַ֣עְלָ⁠ה רֹּ֔אשׁ וְ⁠אַשְׁמָתֵ֥⁠נוּ גָדְלָ֖ה עַ֥ד לַ⁠שָּׁמָֽיִם	1	our iniquities have risen higher than our head, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens	If it would be clearer in your language, you could put this sentence first in the verse, since it gives the reason for the results that the previous sentence describes. You could show the connection by using a word like “so” after this phrase. Alternate translation: “We have committed such great sins that they are overwhelming us, and we know that they are making us guilty before you. And so …” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	9	6	krv9	figs-metaphor	עֲוֺנֹתֵ֤י⁠נוּ רָבוּ֙	1	our iniquities have risen higher than our head, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens	“Multiplied” here means to become much greater in number. Ezra uses that expression figuratively to describe how serious the sins of the Israelites are. Alternate translation: “We have committed such great sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	6	eimq	figs-abstractnouns	עֲוֺנֹתֵ֤י⁠נוּ	1	our iniquities have risen higher than our head, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun “iniquity” with a phrase such as “commit sin.” Alternate translation: “We have committed such great sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	9	6	0zgy	figs-metaphor	לְ⁠מַ֣עְלָ⁠ה רֹּ֔אשׁ	1	our iniquities have risen higher than our head, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens	Ezra uses a spatial [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] to describe the degree to which the sins have figuratively become greater in number. Alternate translation: “they are overwhelming us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “our sins are making us guilty before you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	6	78or	figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠אַשְׁמָתֵ֥⁠נוּ גָדְלָ֖ה	1	our iniquities have risen higher than our head, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun “guilt” with a phrase such as “make guilty.” Alternate translation: “they are making us guilty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	9	6	athx	figs-synecdoche	עַ֥ד לַ⁠שָּׁמָֽיִם	1	our iniquities have risen higher than our head, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens	Here Ezra speaks figuratively of God by reference to something associated with him, “the heavens” or the sky, which was considered to be the place where God lived. Alternate translation: “before you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EZR	9	7	sv5f	figs-idiom	מִ⁠ימֵ֣י אֲבֹתֵ֗י⁠נוּ	1	the days of our fathers	The term “days” is used figuratively here to refer a particular period of time. Alternate translation: “From the time of our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	7	aqdp	bita-hq	אֲבֹתֵ֗י⁠נוּ	1	the days of our fathers	“Fathers” here figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	7	jw4h	figs-idiom	עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	the days of our fathers	In this context, “day” does not refer to one specific day, but rather to a more general time. Alternate translation: “until now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	7	ur0z	figs-synecdoche	אֲנַ֨חְנוּ֙ בְּ⁠אַשְׁמָ֣ה גְדֹלָ֔ה	1	the days of our fathers	Here Ezra speaks figuratively of the disobedience of the Israelites by reference to something associated with it, the guilt that it has caused. Alternate translation: “we have consistently disobeyed you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EZR	9	7	wet1	figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠אַשְׁמָ֣ה גְדֹלָ֔ה	1	very guilty…our iniquities	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun “guilt” with a verb such as “disobey.” Alternate translation: “consistently disobeyed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	9	7	h1bs	figs-activepassive	וּ⁠בַ⁠עֲוֺנֹתֵ֡י⁠נוּ נִתַּ֡נּוּ אֲנַחְנוּ֩…בְּ⁠יַ֣ד׀ מַלְכֵ֣י הָ⁠אֲרָצ֗וֹת	1	we…have been delivered into the hand of kings	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “because we sinned against you, you allowed foreign rulers to conquer us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	9	7	3r9f	figs-metaphor	נִתַּ֡נּוּ אֲנַחְנוּ֩…בְּ⁠יַ֣ד׀ מַלְכֵ֣י הָ⁠אֲרָצ֗וֹת	1	we…have been delivered into the hand of kings	Here “hand” figuratively represents power and control. Alternate translation: “you allowed foreign rulers to conquer us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	7	v9sd	figs-idiom	מַלְכֵ֣י הָ⁠אֲרָצ֗וֹת	1	into the hand of kings of the lands	The “kings of the lands” would be the rulers of the “people of the lands” whom Ezra mentions in verses [1] (../09/01.md) and [2] (../09/02.md), and of similar foreign people groups. Alternate translation: “foreign rulers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Rather, they are all things that happened to the Israelites when they were conquered. Alternate translation: “They killed some of us, they took others of us away from our homeland, they stole the things that belonged to us, and all of this has made us greatly ashamed.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	7	kz7f	figs-metonymy	בַּ⁠חֶ֜רֶב	1	to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to ashamed faces	The sword figuratively represents killing, by reference to one kind of weapon that can kill a person.

EZR	9	7	lc37	figs-abstractnouns	בַּ⁠שְּׁבִ֧י וּ⁠בַ⁠בִּזָּ֛ה	1	to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to ashamed faces	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind abstract nouns “captivity” and “plunder” with verbs such as “take away” and “steal.” Alternate translation: “they took others away from our homeland, they stole the things that belonged to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	9	7	uvig	figs-synecdoche	וּ⁠בְ⁠בֹ֥שֶׁת פָּנִ֖ים	1	to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to ashamed faces	Here Ezra uses the face to describe the whole person figuratively, by reference to one part of a person, their face, which would show their shame by its expression. Alternate translation: “made us greatly ashamed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EZR	9	7	nj7e	figs-idiom	כְּ⁠הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to ashamed faces	In this context, “day” does not refer to one specific day, but rather to a more general time.

EZR	9	8	q4h6	figs-idiom	כִּ⁠מְעַט־רֶגַע֩	1	grace has been shown from Yahweh our God	Alternate translation: “for just a little while” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this word with a phrase such as “be merciful.” Alternate translation:  “Yahweh our God has been merciful to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])<br><br><br><br>
EZR	9	8	ym5g	figs-personification	הָיְתָ֨ה תְחִנָּ֜ה מֵ⁠אֵ֣ת׀ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵ֗י⁠נוּ	1	grace has been shown from Yahweh our God	Ezra speaks here of favor or mercy as if it could travel from Yahweh to the Jews.

But here he speaks of God in the third person to show humility and respect, as people of this time did when speaking to superiors. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words in the second person. Alternate translation: “you, Yahweh our God, have been merciful to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EZR	9	8	vhtl	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠לָ⁠תֶת־לָ֥⁠נוּ יָתֵ֖ד	1	grace has been shown from Yahweh our God	Ezra speaks figuratively of the Jews’ current situation of safety and security as if it were a “peg,” such as one would fasten to a wall in order to hang utensils on it safely and securely. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “brought us into a safe situation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	8	b420	figs-idiom	בִּ⁠מְק֣וֹם קָדְשׁ֑⁠וֹ	1	grace has been shown from Yahweh our God	“Holy” means “set apart for a special purpose.” The temple was God’s “holy place” because it was set apart for his worship. Alternate translation: “in his temple.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	8	jjw0	figs-123person	בִּ⁠מְק֣וֹם קָדְשׁ֑⁠וֹ	1	grace has been shown from Yahweh our God	Here again Ezra speaks of God in the third person.

EZR	9	8	q90t		בִּ⁠מְק֣וֹם קָדְשׁ֑⁠וֹ	1	grace has been shown from Yahweh our God	Ezra speaks of the peg figuratively as if it were in God’s temple, likely because God was considered to be present there. Alternate translation: “in your presence”
EZR	9	8	lst9	figs-metonymy	בִּ⁠מְק֣וֹם קָדְשׁ֑⁠וֹ	1	grace has been shown from Yahweh our God	Ezra may be speaking of the presence of God figuratively by association to mean the protection of God. Alternate translation: “under your protection” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Ezra uses the repetition to emphasize how merciful God has been to the community of returned exiles. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “enable our community to thrive a little even under foreign domination” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase says more specifically how God has accomplished what the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “give us a new vitality by giving us greater freedom even though we are under foreign domination” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EZR	9	8	fzoq	bita-hq	לְ⁠הָאִ֤יר עֵינֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙	1	grace has been shown from Yahweh our God	To brighten the eyes of a person means figuratively to give them a new vitality.

EZR	9	8	54s0	figs-explicit	וּ⁠לְ⁠תִתֵּ֛⁠נוּ מִֽחְיָ֥ה מְעַ֖ט בְּ⁠עַבְדֻתֵֽ⁠נוּ	1	grace has been shown from Yahweh our God	Since Ezra says that God has made the community figuratively more alive “in our bondage,” he seems to be referring implicitly to the greater measure of freedom that King Artaxerxes has allowed them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “by giving us greater freedom even though we are under foreign domination” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	9	9	psz0	figs-litotes	לֹ֥א עֲזָבָ֖⁠נוּ אֱלֹהֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1	but he extended covenant faithfulness to us	Here Ezra uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “our God has continued to help us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
EZR	9	9	n7de	figs-123person	לֹ֥א עֲזָבָ֖⁠נוּ אֱלֹהֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1	but he extended covenant faithfulness to us	Ezra continues to speak of God in the third person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words in the second person. Alternate translation: “you, our God, have not abandoned us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EZR	9	9	5k7w	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַֽ⁠יַּט	1	but he extended covenant faithfulness to us	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces draws a contrast between what the Israelites might have expected God to do, since they were being punished for their disobedience, and what God actually did. You could begin the sentence with a phrase such as “on the contrary” to indicate this contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EZR	9	9	80hr	figs-metaphor	וַֽ⁠יַּט־עָלֵ֣י⁠נוּ חֶ֡סֶד	1	but he extended covenant faithfulness to us	As in [7:28] (../07/28.md), Ezra uses a spatial [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] to depict help figuratively stretching out to him from Yahweh. Alternate translation: “he has helped us, as he promised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	9	xh8d	figs-abstractnouns	וַֽ⁠יַּט־עָלֵ֣י⁠נוּ חֶ֡סֶד לִ⁠פְנֵי֩ מַלְכֵ֨י פָרַ֜ס	1	but he extended covenant faithfulness to us	Here the abstract noun “faithfulness” refers to a person wanting to do everything they can to help another person. As in [3:11] (../03/11.md) and [7:28] (../07/28.md), “covenant faithfulness” refers specifically to Yahweh doing that for the people of Israel, in order to keep the promises he made to them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this word with a verb such as “help.” Alternate translation: “he has helped us, as he promised, by leading the king of Persia to regard us favorably” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	9	9	eb2m	bita-hq	לִ⁠פְנֵי֩ מַלְכֵ֨י פָרַ֜ס	1	in the sight of the king of Persia	Here “face” refers figuratively to the way a person regards things, by association with the way they use the eyes in their face to see things and the way their facial expression shows what they think of those things. Alternate translation: “by leading the kings of Persia to regard us favorably” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	9	9	2kj1	figs-explicit	מַלְכֵ֨י פָרַ֜ס	1	in the sight of the king of Persia	Ezra probably uses the plural “kings” to acknowledge implicitly that not just Artaxerxes, but also Cyrus and Darius before him, treated the Jews favorably by allowing them to rebuild the temple and by supporting the worship there. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could name these kings explicitly. Alternate translation: “King Cyrus, King Darius, and King Artaxerxes of Persia” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	9	9	sc72	figs-metaphor	לָֽ⁠תֶת־לָ֣⁠נוּ מִֽחְיָ֗ה	1	in the sight of the king of Persia	As in [9:8] (../09/08.md), “reviving” or renewed life seems in context to be a figurative expression for greater freedom. Alternate translation: “so that they gave us greater freedom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	9	8dnc	figs-parallelism	לְ⁠רוֹמֵ֞ם אֶת־בֵּ֤ית אֱלֹהֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙ וּ⁠לְ⁠הַעֲמִ֣יד אֶת־חָרְבֹתָ֔י⁠ו	1	in the sight of the king of Persia	These two phrases mean similar things. Ezra says essentially the same thing twice, likely to emphasize how remarkable this was after all the opposition there had been to it. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “and allowed us to rebuild the temple of our God” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase is stronger because it indicates that the temple had previously been destroyed but now it was being restored. Alternate translation: “and allowed us to rebuild the temple of our God by repairing its ruins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EZR	9	9	0pbv	figs-metaphor	לְ⁠רוֹמֵ֞ם	1	in the sight of the king of Persia	To raise up a building is a figurative expression for building it. Alternate translation: “rebuild” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	9	f833	figs-metaphor	וּ⁠לְ⁠הַעֲמִ֣יד	1	the house of our God	Like “raise up,” this is a figurative expression for building. Alternate translation: “repairing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	9	b5aw	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠לָֽ⁠תֶת־לָ֣⁠נוּ גָדֵ֔ר בִּֽ⁠יהוּדָ֖ה וּ⁠בִ⁠ירוּשָׁלִָֽם	1	to give us a wall	Ezra is not referring to a literal wall. (The walls of Jerusalem were still broken down at this time. They would not be repaired until Nehemiah came to the city over a dozen years later.) Rather, he means figuratively that the Persian kings authorized the returned exiles to re-establish their community in Judah and Jerusalem, and so they would protect their right to live there. It is as if the Jews are surrounded by a protective wall. Alternate translation: “and given us a safe place to live in Judah and Jerusalem.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	10	a9fk	figs-rquestion	וְ⁠עַתָּ֛ה מַה־נֹּאמַ֥ר אֱלֹהֵ֖י⁠נוּ אַֽחֲרֵי־זֹ֑את	1	to give us a wall	Ezra is making a statement, not really asking a question. He does not expect God to tell him what excuses he can give for the disobedience of the Israelites. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize that the Israelites really have no excuses. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “So now, our God, we really have no excuses, after you have helped us so much.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EZR	9	10	akg2	figs-metaphor	עָזַ֖בְנוּ מִצְוֺתֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	to give us a wall	As in [8:22] (../08/22.md), forsaking or abandoning God is a [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] for disobeying him or refusing to serve him. Alternate translation: “we have disobeyed your commandments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	11	v7am	figs-metaphor	אֲשֶׁ֣ר צִוִּ֗יתָ בְּ⁠יַ֨ד עֲבָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ הַ⁠נְּבִיאִים֮	1	to give us a wall	Here “hand” figuratively represents control and action. This expression means that God gave these commandments by having the prophets speak them to the people of Israel. Alternate translation: “which you told your servants, the prophets, to speak to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	11	nqdl	figs-quotemarks	לֵ⁠אמֹר֒	1	to give us a wall	After this phrase Ezra begins to quote what the prophets commanded the people on Yahweh’s behalf. So this is a quotation within a quotation. That is, Ezra is quoting the prayer that he prayed on this occasion, and within that prayer, he is quoting what the prophets said. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off these words within secondary quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	9	11	cqpt	figs-metaphor	אֶ֤רֶץ נִדָּה֙ הִ֔יא בְּ⁠נִדַּ֖ת עַמֵּ֣י הָ⁠אֲרָצ֑וֹת	1	to give us a wall	The prophets speak figuratively of the land of Canaan as if it were itself impure, because it was a place where the people did things that were so displeasing to God. Alternate translation: “a land whose inhabitants do things that are displeasing to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	11	6022	figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠נִדַּ֖ת	1	to give us a wall	The prophets speak figuratively of these displeasing things as if they were contaminated. Alternate translation: “things that are displeasing to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	11	t4gi	figs-idiom	עַמֵּ֣י הָ⁠אֲרָצ֑וֹת	1	to give us a wall	See how you translated this expression in [3:3] (../03/03.md). Here refers to members of other people groups who were living in the land of Canaan. Alternate translation: “inhabitants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	11	y2ii	figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠תוֹעֲבֹֽתֵי⁠הֶ֗ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר מִלְא֛וּ⁠הָ	1	to give us a wall	“Abominations,” like “impurity,” refers to things that people do that are displeasing to God. As in [9:1] (../09/01.md), the term indicates that God cannot stand to have these things in his presence. The prophets speak figuratively of these things as if they were accumulating physically and filling up the land. Alternate translation: “throughout the land, they have been doing things that God cannot stand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	11	vo7q	figs-metaphor	מִ⁠פֶּ֥ה אֶל־פֶּ֖ה	1	to give us a wall	Here “mouth” is a figurative way of saying “edge,” “end,” or “extremity,” probably by analogy to the way that the mouth of an animal is typically at one end of the animal. Alternate translation: “from one end to the other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	11	ctyk	figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠טֻמְאָתָֽ⁠ם	1	to give us a wall	The prophets also speak figuratively of these displeasing things as if they were dirty. Alternate translation: “through the things they do that are displeasing to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	12	evio	grammar-connect-logic-result	 וְ֠⁠עַתָּה	1	to give us a wall	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described.

EZR	9	12	sea2	figs-idiom	בְּֽנוֹתֵי⁠כֶ֞ם אַל־תִּתְּנ֣וּ לִ⁠בְנֵי⁠הֶ֗ם	1	to give us a wall	This expression means specifically to give daughters in marriage. Alternate translation: “do not arrange marriages between your daughters and their sons” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	12	9e30	figs-idiom	וּ⁠בְנֹֽתֵי⁠הֶם֙ אַל־תִּשְׂא֣וּ לִ⁠בְנֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	to give us a wall	As in [9:2] (../09/02.md), to “lift a daughter” is an idiom that means to get a wife. Alternate translation: “and do not get wives for your sons from their daughters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	12	o8bm	figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹֽא־תִדְרְשׁ֧וּ שְׁלֹמָ֛⁠ם וְ⁠טוֹבָתָ֖⁠ם עַד־עוֹלָ֑ם	1	to give us a wall	“Until eternity” is a Hebrew expression that means “for as long as anyone can anticipate into the future.” Alternate translation: “and never do anything that contributes to their welfare or prosperity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	12	4q14	figs-doublet	וְ⁠לֹֽא־תִדְרְשׁ֧וּ שְׁלֹמָ֛⁠ם וְ⁠טוֹבָתָ֖⁠ם	1	to give us a wall	“Peace” and “good” mean similar things. The prophets use them together to emphasize the importance of this commandment. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these terms into a single expression, as UST does, saying “cause things to go well.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EZR	9	12	sfei	figs-parallelism	לְמַ֣עַן תֶּחֶזְק֗וּ וַ⁠אֲכַלְתֶּם֙ אֶת־ט֣וּב הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	to give us a wall	These two phrases mean similar things. The prophets say essentially the same thing twice, to emphasize the blessings that the Israelites would enjoy if they obeyed these commandments. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “so that you will become a prosperous nation in that place” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase says more specifically how the nation would become strong, as the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “so that you will become a strong nation by growing and enjoying abundant harvests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EZR	9	12	69c0	figs-idiom	וְ⁠הוֹרַשְׁתֶּ֥ם לִ⁠בְנֵי⁠כֶ֖ם עַד־עוֹלָֽם	1	to give us a wall	As earlier in the sentence, “until eternity” means “for as long as anyone can anticipate into the future.” Alternate translation: “so that your descendants will always be able to live there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	12	91e8	bita-hq	לִ⁠בְנֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1	to give us a wall	“Sons” here figuratively means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “your descendants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	9	12	uax9	figs-quotemarks	עַד־עוֹלָֽם	1	forever	After this phrase Ezra ends his quotation of what Yahweh commanded through the prophets. If you decided in verse [11] (../09/11.md) to mark their words as a secondary quotation, you should indicate that ending here with a closing secondary quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	9	13	am2g	figs-parallelism	בְּ⁠מַעֲשֵׂ֨י⁠נוּ֙ הָ⁠רָעִ֔ים וּ⁠בְ⁠אַשְׁמָתֵ֖⁠נוּ הַ⁠גְּדֹלָ֑ה	1	forever	These two phrases mean similar things. Ezra uses the repetition for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “since we are so guilty because of the wrong things we have done” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. Alternate translation: “since have committed such great sins, and since we are so guilty as a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EZR	9	13	ulhq	writing-background	כִּ֣י	1	forever	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces will provide background information about the situation that Ezra is describing. Alternate translation: “in fact” (See: Connect - [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EZR	9	13	hd7r	figs-idiom	חָשַׂ֤כְתָּֽ לְ⁠מַ֨טָּה֙ מֵֽ⁠עֲוֺנֵ֔⁠נוּ	1	forever	This is a Hebrew idiom. Alternate translation: “have not punished us as fully as our sins deserve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	13	w379	figs-explicit	וְ⁠נָתַ֥תָּה לָּ֛⁠נוּ פְּלֵיטָ֖ה כָּ⁠זֹֽאת	1	forever	Ezra is referring implicitly to himself and to the other Jews who have returned from exile.

EZR	9	14	jh1x	figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠נָשׁוּב֙ לְ⁠הָפֵ֣ר מִצְוֺתֶ֔י⁠ךָ וּ֨⁠לְ⁠הִתְחַתֵּ֔ן בְּ⁠עַמֵּ֥י הַ⁠תֹּעֵב֖וֹת הָ⁠אֵ֑לֶּה	1	should we again break your commandments and intermarry with the people of these abominations?	Ezra is making a statement, not really asking a question. He does not expect God to tell him whether the people should once again disobey. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize how important it is for them to stop intermarrying with the other people groups. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate these words as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “we certainly should not break your commandments again by intermarrying with peoples who do things that you cannot stand!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EZR	9	14	pm7m	figs-idiom	בְּ⁠עַמֵּ֥י הַ⁠תֹּעֵב֖וֹת הָ⁠אֵ֑לֶּה	1	should we again break your commandments and intermarry with the people of these abominations?	As in [9:1] (../09/01.md) and [9:11] (../09/11.md), the term “abominations” refers to things that God cannot stand to have in his presence. Alternate translation: “the people groups who do these things that God cannot stand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	14	mn62	figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ל֤וֹא תֶֽאֱנַף־בָּ֨⁠נוּ֙ עַד־כַּלֵּ֔ה לְ⁠אֵ֥ין שְׁאֵרִ֖ית וּ⁠פְלֵיטָֽה	1	Would you not be angry…no remnant or survivor?	Once again Ezra is making a statement, not really asking a question. He does not expect God to tell him whether he would be angry with the Jews. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize how angry God would become. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate these words as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “If we did that, you would be totally angry with us, and you would not leave any of us here.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EZR	9	14	1lu0	figs-idiom	תֶֽאֱנַף־בָּ֨⁠נוּ֙ עַד־כַּלֵּ֔ה	1	Would you not be angry…no remnant or survivor?	This is a Hebrew idiom. Alternate translation: “totally angry with us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	14	1lm6	figs-doublet	לְ⁠אֵ֥ין שְׁאֵרִ֖ית וּ⁠פְלֵיטָֽה	1	Would you not be angry…no remnant or survivor?	“Remnant” and “survivors” mean the same thing. Ezra uses the terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “you would not leave any of us here.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EZR	9	15	qhg9	grammar-connect-logic-result	 יְהוָ֞ה אֱלֹהֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ צַדִּ֣יק אַ֔תָּה כִּֽי־נִשְׁאַ֥רְנוּ פְלֵיטָ֖ה כְּ⁠הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	Look	If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for what the first phrase says. Alternate translation: “Only a small number of us are now left, and we acknowledge that you, Yahweh, the God of Israel, were right to punish us this way.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	9	15	nw97	figs-idiom	כְּ⁠הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	Look	In this context, “day” does not refer to one specific day, but rather to a more general time. Alternate translation: “now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	15	a177	figs-parallelism	הִנְ⁠נ֤וּ לְ⁠פָנֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙ בְּ⁠אַשְׁמָתֵ֔י⁠נוּ כִּ֣י אֵ֥ין לַ⁠עֲמ֛וֹד לְ⁠פָנֶ֖י⁠ךָ עַל־זֹֽאת	1	We are before you in our guilt	These two phrases mean similar things. Ezra uses the repetition for emphasis as he makes this confession of guilt on behalf of the people. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “We have come into your presence to admit that we are guilty.” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase is more intensive. Alternate translation: “We have come into your presence to admit that we are guilty, and none of us can plead any grounds for acquittal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EZR	9	15	lh5h	bita-hq	לְ⁠פָנֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	no one can stand before you because of this	Here “face” figuratively represents the presence of a person. Alternate translation: “into your presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	9	15	el20	figs-idiom	אֵ֥ין לַ⁠עֲמ֛וֹד לְ⁠פָנֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1	no one can stand before you because of this	To “stand” is a Hebrew idiom meaning to be acquitted. (For example, in Psalm 130:3, “If you, Yahweh, would mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand?” and Psalm 1:5, “The wicked will not stand in the judgment.”) Alternate translation: “none of us can plead any grounds for acquittal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	9	15	8lk8	figs-quotemarks	לְ⁠פָנֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1	no one can stand before you because of this	This is the end of Ezra’s quotation of the prayer that he prayed on this occasion. If you decided in verse [6] (../09/06.md) to mark his words as a direct quotation, you should indicate that ending here with a closing primary quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation.

You could also show the connection by using a phrase like “and so.” Alternate translation: “While Ezra was praying this prayer of confession, the people began to weep very bitterly because they realized that they had sinned and were guilty. And so a very large crowd of Israelites … gathered to him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “pleading with God by falling down onto the ground in front of the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EZR	10	1	vcs1	figs-metaphor	לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י בֵּ֣ית הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	before the house of God	Here “face” figuratively means the front of a place. Alternate translation: “in front of the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	10	1	ry9k	figs-explicit	בָכ֥וּ הָ⁠עָ֖ם הַרְבֵּה־בֶֽכֶה	1	before the house of God	The implication is that the people were weeping because they realized what a wrong thing they had done and how guilty they were because of it.

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	10	2	af7v	figs-metaphor	אֲנַ֨חְנוּ֙ מָעַ֣לְנוּ בֵ⁠אלֹהֵ֔י⁠נוּ	1	We have been unfaithful to our God	As in [9:2] (../09/02.md) and [9:4] (../09/04.md), “unfaithfulness” figuratively means disobedience. Alternate translation: “We ourselves have disobeyed our God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 
EZR	10	2	jfau	figs-idiom	וַ⁠נֹּ֛שֶׁב נָשִׁ֥ים נָכְרִיּ֖וֹת מֵ⁠עַמֵּ֣י הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	We have been unfaithful to our God	To “cause to dwell” is an idiom that means “to marry.” Alternate translation: “and have married foreign women from the other people groups living in the land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	2	kucg	figs-idiom	מֵ⁠עַמֵּ֣י הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	We have been unfaithful to our God	This expression refers to the other people groups who were living in and around the province of Judah. Alternate translation: “the other people groups living in the land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	2	dp2y	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ⁠עַתָּ֛ה	1	We have been unfaithful to our God	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces draws a contrast between the way the situation appeared to be hopeless and the fact that the Jews could still do something about it. You could begin the sentence with a word such as “nevertheless” to indicate this contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EZR	10	2	k21b	figs-personification	וְ⁠עַתָּ֛ה יֵשׁ־מִקְוֶ֥ה לְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל עַל־זֹֽאת	1	We have been unfaithful to our God	Here Shekaniah refers to all of the Israelites figuratively as if they were a single person, their ancestor, Israel. Alternate translation: “there is still hope for the Israelites in this matter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
EZR	10	2	6euk	figs-123person	וְ⁠עַתָּ֛ה יֵשׁ־מִקְוֶ֥ה לְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל עַל־זֹֽאת	1	We have been unfaithful to our God	Though Shekaniah speaks of the Israelites in the third person, the term includes himself. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this phrase in the second person. Alternate translation: “there is still hope for us in this matter” or “there is still something that we can do about this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EZR	10	2	yh2o	figs-inclusive	וְ⁠עַתָּ֛ה יֵשׁ־מִקְוֶ֥ה לְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל עַל־זֹֽאת	1	We have been unfaithful to our God	Since Shekaniah is speaking to Ezra and the term “the Israelites” applies to him as well, if you choose to translate this phrase in the second person, the term “us” or “we” should include the addressee, if your language marks that distinction. Alternate translation: “there is still hope for us in this matter” or “there is still something that we can do about this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
EZR	10	3	1sow	figs-idiom	נִֽכְרָת־בְּרִ֣ית	1	We have been unfaithful to our God	This is a Hebrew idiom that means to make or enter into a covenant, which is a solemn agreement between two parties. Alternate translation: “make a solemn agreement” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	3	w4zm	figs-idiom	לְ⁠הוֹצִ֨יא כָל־נָשִׁ֜ים וְ⁠הַ⁠נּוֹלָ֤ד מֵ⁠הֶם֙	1	We have been unfaithful to our God	“To cause to go out” is a Hebrew idiom that means to divorce and send away. Alternate translation: “to divorce and send away all of these foreign wives and their children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	3	zmyn	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הַ⁠נּוֹלָ֤ד מֵ⁠הֶם֙	1	We have been unfaithful to our God	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a noun to represent this phrase that uses a passive verb form. Alternate translation: “their children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	10	3	iljp	figs-123person	בַּ⁠עֲצַ֣ת אֲדֹנָ֔⁠י	1	We have been unfaithful to our God	Shekaniah addresses Ezra in the third person as a sign of respect. If it would be clearer in your language, you can translate this with the second person. “We will do it in the way that you advise” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EZR	10	3	7zvz	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הַ⁠חֲרֵדִ֖ים בְּ⁠מִצְוַ֣ת אֱלֹהֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1	We have been unfaithful to our God	As in [9:4] (../09/04.md), “tremble” is a [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] meaning to regard someone or something with respect and reverential fear. Alternate translation: “and in the way that seems right to everyone who respects the commandment of our God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	10	3	hla5	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠כַ⁠תּוֹרָ֖ה יֵעָשֶֽׂה	1	We have been unfaithful to our God	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “And let us make sure that we are following what the law commands.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	10	4	tx9m	figs-idiom	ק֛וּם	1	we are with you	Here, as in several other places in the book, “arise” means to take action to get an enterprise under way. Alternate translation: “Do something about this situation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	4	8o5k	figs-idiom	כִּֽי־עָלֶ֥י⁠ךָ הַ⁠דָּבָ֖ר	1	we are with you	This is a Hebrew idiom. Alternate translation:  “because this is your responsibility.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	4	d8d8	figs-idiom	כִּֽי־עָלֶ֥י⁠ךָ הַ⁠דָּבָ֖ר	1	we are with you	The implication is that this was Ezra’s responsibility because King Artaxerxes had given him the mandate to teach the Jews to follow the commandments of Yahweh and the authority to ensure that they did. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation:  “because this is your responsibility, since the king told you to teach us Yahweh’s commandments and make sure that we followed them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	4	m4vg		וַ⁠אֲנַ֣חְנוּ עִמָּ֑⁠ךְ	1	we are with you	Alternate translation: “we will support you”
EZR	10	4	hrga	figs-ellipsis	חֲזַ֖ק וַ⁠עֲשֵֽׂה	1	we are with you	Here Shekaniah leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “Be strong and take action to address this matter.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	10	4	5hrm	figs-quotemarks	חֲזַ֖ק וַ⁠עֲשֵֽׂה	1	we are with you	After this phrase, the book ends its quotation of what Shekaniah said to Ezra on this occasion. If you decided in verse [2] (../10/02.md) to mark his words as a quotation, you should indicate their ending here with a closing quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	10	5	v0zf	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יָּ֣קָם	1	we are with you	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentences described. Alternate translation: “as a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	10	5	p6uh	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יָּ֣קָם עֶזְרָ֡א	1	we are with you	Once again “arise” means to take action to get an enterprise under way. Alternate translation: “Ezra took action” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	5	medp	figs-explicit	לַ⁠עֲשׂ֛וֹת כַּ⁠דָּבָ֥ר הַ⁠זֶּ֖ה	1	we are with you	The implication in context is that “this word” refers to Shekaniah’s recommendation that the Jews send away all the foreign wives and their children. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to do what Shekaniah had recommended and make the Israelites send away all the foreign wives and their children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	10	6	k8jp	figs-metaphor	מִ⁠לִּ⁠פְנֵי֙ בֵּ֣ית הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	Jehohanan…Eliashib	As in [10:1] (../10/01.md), “face” here figuratively means the front of a place. Alternate translation: “from in front of the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	10	6	j78q	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֕לֶךְ אֶל־לִשְׁכַּ֖ת יְהוֹחָנָ֣ן בֶּן־אֶלְיָשִׁ֑יב	1	Jehohanan…Eliashib	As in [8:29] (../08/29.md), “chamber” means a room, and in context here it seems to refer similarly to one of the rooms in the temple. Eliashib was the high priest, and so it is probable that one of his family members would have had a room there. The book does not say why Ezra went to one of the rooms in the temple, but the implication is that he did so in order to meet further with the community leaders and make plans for the assembly that the following verses describe. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “And he went to one of the rooms in the temple, the one that belonged to Jehohanan the grandson of Eliashib, to meet further with the leaders to make plans to call an assembly of all the returned exiles.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	10	6	z4zq	bita-hq	יְהוֹחָנָ֣ן בֶּן־אֶלְיָשִׁ֑יב	1	Jehohanan…Eliashib	Jehohanan was actually the grandson of Eliashib, so “son” figuratively means “descendant.” Alternate translation: “Jehohanan the grandson of Eliashib” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	10	6	j3bg	translate-names	יְהוֹחָנָ֣ן…אֶלְיָשִׁ֑יב	1	Jehohanan…Eliashib	These are the names of two men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	10	6	vkgv	figs-ellipsis	וַ⁠יֵּ֣לֶךְ שָׁ֗ם לֶ֤חֶם לֹֽא־אָכַל֙ וּ⁠מַ֣יִם לֹֽא־שָׁתָ֔ה	1	Jehohanan…Eliashib	Here the book leaves out some of the words that would ordinarily be needed in order to express a complete meaning. Alternate translation: “When he went there, he did not eat or drink anything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	10	6	b5wa	grammar-connect-logic-result	לֶ֤חֶם לֹֽא־אָכַל֙ וּ⁠מַ֣יִם לֹֽא־שָׁתָ֔ה כִּ֥י מִתְאַבֵּ֖ל עַל־מַ֥עַל הַ⁠גּוֹלָֽה	1	Jehohanan…Eliashib	If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because he was still grieving over the way the Jews who had returned to their homeland had disobeyed, he did not eat or drink anything.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	10	6	fwd9	translate-symaction	לֶ֤חֶם לֹֽא־אָכַל֙ וּ⁠מַ֣יִם לֹֽא־שָׁתָ֔ה כִּ֥י מִתְאַבֵּ֖ל עַל־מַ֥עַל הַ⁠גּוֹלָֽה	1	Jehohanan…Eliashib	Not eating or drinking was a symbolic action whose purpose was to show that Ezra was grieving over the disobedience of the exiles. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to show that he was still grieving over the way the Jews who had returned to their homeland had disobeyed, he did not eat or drink anything.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EZR	10	6	3s2r	figs-synecdoche	לֶ֤חֶם לֹֽא־אָכַל֙ וּ⁠מַ֣יִם לֹֽא־שָׁתָ֔ה	1	Jehohanan…Eliashib	It is likely that the story is using bread, one kind of food, to represent all food, and that it is using water, one kind of drink, to represent all drink. Alternate translation: “He did not eat or drink anything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EZR	10	6	s6oc	figs-metaphor	מַ֥עַל הַ⁠גּוֹלָֽה	1	Jehohanan…Eliashib	“Unfaithfulness” figuratively means disobedience. Alternate translation: “the way the Jews who had returned to their homeland had disobeyed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	10	6	1t20	figs-abstractnouns	מַ֥עַל הַ⁠גּוֹלָֽה	1	Jehohanan…Eliashib	The abstract noun “exiles” describes the Jews who had returned to their homeland from Babylon. (The term seems to be equivalent to the longer phrase “the sons of the exile” that is used in several places in the book, including in the next verse.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the way the Jews who had returned to their homeland had disobeyed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	10	7	7gfd	figs-metonymy	 וַ⁠יַּעֲבִ֨ירוּ ק֜וֹל בִּ⁠יהוּדָ֣ה וִ⁠ירֽוּשָׁלִַ֗ם	1	Jehohanan…Eliashib	As in [1:1] (../01/01.md), this “voice” is a voice speaking a message, and it figuratively represents the message that the voice speaks. But since the message could not travel by itself, ultimately the reference is to the messengers who delivered it. Alternate translation: “they sent messengers throughout Judah and Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	10	7	sni5	figs-idiom	בְּנֵ֣י הַ⁠גּוֹלָ֔ה	1	Jehohanan…Eliashib	As indicated in [2:1](../02/01.md) and [8:35](../08/35.md), the phrase **the sons of the exile** refers specifically to the group of Jewish people who returned to the land of Judah from Babylon after King Nebuchadnezzar had conquered Jerusalem and has taken many Jews as captives to Babylon. Alternate translation: “the Jews who had returned from exile” or “the Jews who had returned to their homeland” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	7	4khl	figs-abstractnouns	בְּנֵ֣י הַ⁠גּוֹלָ֔ה	1	Jehohanan…Eliashib	The abstract noun “exile” refers to the way the Babylonians had taken the Jews as captives and transported them away from their homeland. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this term with a verb such as “return,” which would describe the present situation of some of these Jews and their descendants. Alternate translation: “the Jews who had returned to their homeland” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	10	8	tv2h		כַּ⁠עֲצַ֤ת הַ⁠שָּׂרִים֙ וְ⁠הַ⁠זְּקֵנִ֔ים	1	Everyone who did not come…all his property would be forfeited, and he would be excluded	Alternate translation: “as the leaders and elders had specified they must”
EZR	10	8	a5ia	figs-idiom	יָחֳרַ֖ם כָּל־רְכוּשׁ֑⁠וֹ	1	three days	“Devoted to the ban” is an idiom that refers to the complete loss of property. While in earlier times this would have meant that the property would be totally destroyed, in this context it likely meant that it would be confiscated and sold and that the proceeds would be put in the temple treasury. Alternate translation: “all of his property would be confiscated” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	8	0f6s	figs-idiom	וְ⁠ה֥וּא יִבָּדֵ֖ל מִ⁠קְּהַ֥ל הַ⁠גּוֹלָֽה	1	three days	“Separated from the assembly” is a Hebrew idiom that means to be expelled from the community and no longer considered a Jew. Alternate translation: “And he himself would be expelled from the Jewish community.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	8	1nmq	figs-abstractnouns	מִ⁠קְּהַ֥ל הַ⁠גּוֹלָֽה	1	three days	As often in the book, the abstract noun “exiles” here refers to the way the Jews had been transported away from their homeland but had since returned. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this term with a verb such as “return.” Alternate translation: “the community of Jews who had returned to their homeland” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	10	9	kp1w	grammar-connect-logic-result	 וַ⁠יִּקָּבְצ֣וּ	1	in three days	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	10	9	2e29	figs-personification	כָל־אַנְשֵֽׁי־יְהוּדָה֩ וּ⁠בִנְיָמִ֨ן	1	in three days	Here the story refers to all of the descendants of Judah figuratively as if they were a single person, their ancestor, Judah, and similarly to the descendants of Benjamin as if they were a single person, their ancestor, Benjamin. Alternate translation: “all the men from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
EZR	10	9	pfo4	figs-synecdoche	כָל־אַנְשֵֽׁי־יְהוּדָה֩ וּ⁠בִנְיָמִ֨ן	1	in three days	Since the assembly included Israelites from other tribes (for example, the priests and the Levites, who were both from the tribe of Levi), the book is using the tribes of Judah and Benjamin to represent all the Israelite tribes. Alternate translation: “all the Israelite men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EZR	10	9	e785	figs-metonymy	כָל־אַנְשֵֽׁי־יְהוּדָה֩ וּ⁠בִנְיָמִ֨ן	1	in three days	Another way to look at this is that the book is describing all of the Israelites figuratively by reference to something associated with them, the area in which they were now living, which had previously been the territory of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. Alternate translation: “all the Israelite men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	10	9	v2eh	translate-hebrewmonths	ה֛וּא חֹ֥דֶשׁ הַ⁠תְּשִׁיעִ֖י בְּ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֣ים בַּ⁠חֹ֑דֶשׁ	1	ninth month and the twentieth day of the month	You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to use the numbers of the Hebrew day and month. Alternate translation: “It was the twentieth day of the ninth month” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
EZR	10	9	6eco	figs-explicit	ה֛וּא חֹ֥דֶשׁ הַ⁠תְּשִׁיעִ֖י בְּ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֣ים בַּ⁠חֹ֑דֶשׁ	1	ninth month and the twentieth day of the month	Since the story does not say otherwise, the implication is that this was still the same year in which Ezra returned to Jerusalem, that is, the seventh year of Artaxerxes. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “It was the twentieth day of the ninth month in the seventh year of Artaxerxes as king of Persia.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	10	9	egr3	translate-ordinal	בְּ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֣ים בַּ⁠חֹ֑דֶשׁ	1	ninth month and the twentieth day of the month	The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, “twenty,” but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, “twentieth,” in similar contexts elsewhere. If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of days, you can do that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “on the twentieth day of month” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EZR	10	9	j9d3	translate-unknown	בִּ⁠רְחוֹב֙ בֵּ֣ית הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	in the square	“Open place” means a “plaza” or “square” in the city where there were no buildings and so where large gatherings like this could be held. Alternate translation: “in the temple square” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EZR	10	9	qlio	figs-metaphor	מַרְעִידִ֥ים עַל־הַ⁠דָּבָ֖ר וּ⁠מֵ⁠הַ⁠גְּשָׁמִֽים	1	in the square	As elsewhere in the book, “tremble” here may be a [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] meaning to regard someone or something with respect and reverential fear. However, the people were likely trembling literally because of the rain, that is, shaking with cold. So the book is either mixing figurative and literal uses of the same term, or the people were literally shaking because they were all being called to account for a serious disobedience. Alternate translation: “deeply serious about the issue of disobedience and shaking with cold from the rain” or “shaking with fear because they were being called to account for disobedience and shaking with cold because of the rain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	10	10	o09g	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יָּ֨קָם עֶזְרָ֤א הַ⁠כֹּהֵן֙ וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֲלֵ⁠הֶ֔ם	1	have acted unfaithfully	As often in the book, “arise” here means to take action to get an enterprise under way. Alternate translation: “Ezra began the assembly by saying to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	10	rlnr	figs-informremind	עֶזְרָ֤א הַ⁠כֹּהֵן֙	1	have acted unfaithfully	Here the book repeats some background information to remind readers who Ezra was. Alternate translation: “Ezra, who was a priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EZR	10	10	wr45	figs-quotemarks	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֲלֵ⁠הֶ֔ם	1	have acted unfaithfully	After this phrase the book begins to quote what Ezra said to the assembly. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	10	10	x4sz	figs-metaphor	מְעַלְתֶּ֔ם וַ⁠תֹּשִׁ֖יבוּ נָשִׁ֣ים נָכְרִיּ֑וֹת	1	have acted unfaithfully	“Unfaithfulness” figuratively means disobedience. Alternate translation: “disobeyed by marrying foreign women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	10	10	v95n	figs-metaphor	מְעַלְתֶּ֔ם וַ⁠תֹּשִׁ֖יבוּ נָשִׁ֣ים נָכְרִיּ֑וֹת	1	adding to the guilt of Israel	The implication is that this was disobedience to the commandment of Yahweh. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “disobeyed the commandment of Yahweh by marrying foreign women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	10	10	nduh	figs-idiom	וַ⁠תֹּשִׁ֖יבוּ נָשִׁ֣ים נָכְרִיּ֑וֹת	1	adding to the guilt of Israel	See how you translated this expression in [10:2] (../10/02.md). Alternate translation: “have married foreign women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	11	40l7	figs-idiom	וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה תְּנ֥וּ תוֹדָ֛ה לַ⁠יהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵֽי־אֲבֹתֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1	separate yourselves	In this context, “give praise” is an idiom that means “make confession.” Alternate translation: “confess to Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, that you have sinned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	11	b2x3	bita-hq	אֱלֹהֵֽי־אֲבֹתֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1	separate yourselves	“Fathers” here figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “the God of your ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	10	11	man9	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠עֲשׂ֣וּ רְצוֹנ֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠הִבָּֽדְלוּ֙ מֵ⁠עַמֵּ֣י הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ וּ⁠מִן־הַ⁠נָּשִׁ֖ים הַ⁠נָּכְרִיּֽוֹת	1	separate yourselves	With regard to the other people groups, the word “separate” means dissolving the alliances that had been formed with them by marriage. With regard to the foreign wives, it is a figurative term for divorce. Alternate translation: “and obey him by divorcing and sending away your foreign wives, and thereby breaking the alliances you have formed with the other people groups living in the land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	10	11	eyne	figs-idiom	מֵ⁠עַמֵּ֣י הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	separate yourselves	This expression refers to the other people groups who were living in and around the province of Judah. Alternate translation: “the other people groups living in the land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	11	ofga	figs-quotemarks	הַ⁠נָּשִׁ֖ים הַ⁠נָּכְרִיּֽוֹת	1	separate yourselves	After this phrase, the book ends its quotation of what Ezra said to the assembly on this occasion. If you decided in verse [10] (../10/10.md) to mark his words as a quotation, you should indicate their ending here with a closing quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	10	12	tatu	figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יַּֽעְנ֧וּ...וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֖וּ	1	separate yourselves	See how you translated this expression in [10:2] (../10/02.md). Alternate translation: “responded” (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
EZR	10	12	hvpb	figs-quotemarks	ק֣וֹל גָּד֑וֹל 	1	separate yourselves	After this phrase the book begins to quote what the assembly replied to Ezra.

EZR	10	12	jgje	figs-idiom	כֵּ֛ן כִּדְבָרְךָ֥ עָלֵ֖י⁠נוּ לַ⁠עֲשֽׂוֹת	1	separate yourselves	Like the similar expression “the matter is on you” in [10:4] (../10/04.md), this is a Hebrew idiom. Alternate translation:  “We agree, it is our responsibility to do what you have said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	13	sjoy	figs-explicit	הָ⁠עָ֥ם רָב֙	1	this is not the work of one or two days	The implication is that there are too many people potentially involved with the problem to deal with all at once. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “there are too many people to deal with all at once” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	10	13	6s3z	figs-idiom	וְ⁠הָ⁠עֵ֣ת גְּשָׁמִ֔ים וְ⁠אֵ֥ין כֹּ֖חַ לַ⁠עֲמ֣וֹד בַּ⁠ח֑וּץ	1	this is not the work of one or two days	To say that there is “no strength” for something is an idiom in Hebrew meaning that it is too difficult. Alternate translation: “it is too much of a hardship to make everyone stand outside during the rainy season” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	13	0oap	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֗ה לֹֽא־לְ⁠י֤וֹם אֶחָד֙ וְ⁠לֹ֣א לִ⁠שְׁנַ֔יִם כִּֽי־הִרְבִּ֥ינוּ לִ⁠פְשֹׁ֖עַ בַּ⁠דָּבָ֥ר הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	this is not the work of one or two days	If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Because so many of us have disobeyed Yahweh and married foreign women, it will take a long time to identify them all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	10	13	wqu4	figs-idiom	וְ⁠הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֗ה לֹֽא־לְ⁠י֤וֹם אֶחָד֙ וְ⁠לֹ֣א לִ⁠שְׁנַ֔יִם	1	this is not the work of one or two days	“One day or two” is a figurative way of saying “a short time.” Alternate translation: “it will take a long time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	14	fcw7	figs-idiom	יַֽעֲמְדוּ־נָ֣א שָׂ֠רֵי⁠נוּ לְֽ⁠כָל־הַ⁠קָּהָ֞ל	1	at the appointed time with the elders and judges of each of their cities	Here “stand for” is an idiom that means “represent.” (Verse [16] (../10/16.md) explains specifically how the community arranged for its leaders to be its representatives.) Alternate translation: “Let our leaders represent all of us.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	14	wybo	figs-idiom	הַ⁠הֹשִׁ֞יב נָשִׁ֤ים נָכְרִיּוֹת֙	1	at the appointed time with the elders and judges of each of their cities	See how you translated this expression in [10:2] (../10/02.md). Alternate translation: “have married foreign women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	14	wvv6	figs-idiom	יָבֹא֙...וְ⁠עִמָּ⁠הֶ֛ם זִקְנֵי־עִ֥יר וָ⁠עִ֖יר וְ⁠שֹׁפְטֶ֑י⁠הָ	1	at the appointed time with the elders and judges of each of their cities	“City by city” is an idiom that means “each city.” Alternate translation: “come with the elders and judges of each city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	14	1dri	bita-hq	עַ֠ד לְ⁠הָשִׁ֞יב חֲר֤וֹן אַף־אֱלֹהֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙ מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ עַ֖ד לַ⁠דָּבָ֥ר הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	at the appointed time with the elders and judges of each of their cities	In Hebrew, a burning nose figuratively represents anger, and if someone’s anger is “turned back,” that means figuratively that they are no longer angry. Alternate translation: “until God is no longer angry with us for disobeying in this way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	10	14	cs93	figs-quotemarks	לַ⁠דָּבָ֥ר הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	at the appointed time with the elders and judges of each of their cities	After this phrase, the book ends its quotation of what the assembly replied to Ezra on this occasion. If you decided in verse [12] (../10/12.md) to mark their words as a quotation, you should indicate their ending here with a closing quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EZR	10	15	arho	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	 אַ֣ךְ	1	Jonathan…Asahel…Jahzeiah…Tikvah…Meshullam…Shabbethai	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces draws a contrast between the willingness of almost the entire assembly to pursue this matter and the opposition of these four men. You could begin the sentence with a word such as “however” to indicate this contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EZR	10	15	z2yc	figs-explicit	יוֹנָתָ֧ן…וְ⁠יַחְזְיָ֥ה…עָמְד֣וּ עַל־זֹ֑את וּ⁠מְשֻׁלָּ֛ם וְ⁠שַׁבְּתַ֥י...עֲזָרֻֽ⁠ם	1	Jonathan…Asahel…Jahzeiah…Tikvah…Meshullam…Shabbethai	The implication is that while these four men spoke up in the assembly against investigating who among the Israelites had married foreign wives, their protests were unsuccessful. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jonathan … and Jahzeiah … did not want the community to investigate who had married foreign women. And Meshullam and Shabbethai … supported them. But they were not able to convince the assembly.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	10	15	piy5	translate-names	יוֹנָתָ֧ן בֶּן־עֲשָׂהאֵ֛ל	1	Jonathan…Asahel…Jahzeiah…Tikvah…Meshullam…Shabbethai	Jonathan is the name of a man, and Asahel is the name of his father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

EZR	10	15	sl99	figs-metaphor	עָמְד֣וּ עַל־זֹ֑את	1	Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah opposed this	To stand against something means figuratively to oppose it. Alternate translation: “did not want the community to investigate who had married foreign women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	10	15	uu1e	bita-hq	וּ⁠מְשֻׁלָּ֛ם וְ⁠שַׁבְּתַ֥י	1	Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah opposed this	These are the names of two men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	10	16	jyy9	figs-abstractnouns	וַ⁠יַּֽעֲשׂוּ־כֵן֮ בְּנֵ֣י הַ⁠גּוֹלָה֒	1	did this	See how you translated the expression “the sons of the exile” in [10:7](../10/07.md). Alternate translation: “So the Jews who had returned to their homeland did what their assembly had decided” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EZR	10	16	sz6j	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּבָּדְלוּ֩ עֶזְרָ֨א הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֜ן אֲנָשִׁ֨ים רָאשֵׁ֧י הָ⁠אָב֛וֹת לְ⁠בֵ֥ית אֲבֹתָ֖⁠ם וְ⁠כֻלָּ֣⁠ם בְּ⁠שֵׁמ֑וֹת	1	did this	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Ezra the priest summoned the leaders of each clan by name” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EZR	10	16	1rw5	figs-ellipsis	רָאשֵׁ֧י הָ⁠אָב֛וֹת לְ⁠בֵ֥ית אֲבֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	did this	As in [1:5] (../01/05.md) and many other places in the book, “the heads of the fathers” is an abbreviated way of saying “the heads of father’s houses,” and the “house of the father” or “father’s house” means a clan. Alternate translation: “the leaders of each clan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EZR	10	16	0oo5	figs-informremind	עֶזְרָ֨א הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֜ן	1	did this	Here the book repeats some background information to remind readers who Ezra was. Alternate translation: “Ezra, who was a priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EZR	10	16	brup	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יֵּשְׁב֗וּ	1	did this	While it is likely that these leaders conducted their inquiry while sitting down, “sat down” here is a figurative way of saying “convened” or “met to do business.” Alternate translation: “they met for the first time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	10	16	c2z7	translate-hebrewmonths	בְּ⁠י֤וֹם אֶחָד֙ לַ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הָ⁠עֲשִׂירִ֔י	1	the first day of the tenth month	You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to use the numbers of the Hebrew day and month. Alternate translation: “on the first day of the tenth month” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
EZR	10	16	waht	translate-ordinal	בְּ⁠י֤וֹם אֶחָד֙ לַ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הָ⁠עֲשִׂירִ֔י	1	the first day of the tenth month	The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, “one,” but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, “first,” in similar contexts elsewhere. If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of days, you can do that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “on the first day of the tenth month” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EZR	10	16	2pyq	figs-metaphor	לְ⁠דַרְי֖וֹשׁ הַ⁠דָּבָֽר	1	the first day of the tenth month	“Seek out” here figuratively means to “investigate.” Alternate translation: “to investigate who had married foreign women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	10	17	i02i	figs-idiom	 וַ⁠יְכַלּ֣וּ בַ⁠כֹּ֔ל אֲנָשִׁ֕ים	1	first day of the first month	“Finished with” is an idiom here. Alternate translation: “they succeeded in identifying all the men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	17	gtyy	figs-idiom	הַ⁠הֹשִׁ֖יבוּ נָשִׁ֣ים נָכְרִיּ֑וֹת	1	first day of the first month	See how you translated this expression in [10:2] (../10/02.md). Alternate translation: “who had married foreign women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	17	kgk5	translate-hebrewmonths	י֥וֹם אֶחָ֖ד לַ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ הָ⁠רִאשֽׁוֹן	1	first day of the first month	You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to use the numbers of the Hebrew day and month. Alternate translation: “by the first day of the first month” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
EZR	10	17	024d	translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם אֶחָ֖ד לַ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ הָ⁠רִאשֽׁוֹן	1	first day of the first month	The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, “one,” but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, “first,” in similar contexts elsewhere.

Alternate translation: “on the first day of the tenth month” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EZR	10	18	rqg8	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּמָּצֵא֙ מִ⁠בְּנֵ֣י	1	Jeshua	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. “The clan leaders identified some men” Alternate translation: (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) 
EZR	10	18	1pyw	bita-hq	מִ⁠בְּנֵ֣י הַ⁠כֹּהֲנִ֔ים	1	Jeshua	“Son of” here is a figurative expression that indicates that a person shares the qualities of something. Hebrew often uses the expression to describe a person’s occupation. Alternate translation: “among the priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	18	80rr	figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁ֥ר הֹשִׁ֖יבוּ נָשִׁ֣ים נָכְרִיּ֑וֹת	1	Jeshua	See how you translated this expression in [10:2] (../10/02.md). Alternate translation: “who had married foreign women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	18	sf5b	bita-hq	מִ⁠בְּנֵ֨י יֵשׁ֤וּעַ בֶּן־יֽוֹצָדָק֙ וְ⁠אֶחָ֔י⁠ו	1	Maaseiah…Gedaliah	“Sons” here figuratively means “descendants,” since Jeshua lived many years before this time, but “son” is literal because Jeshu was the biological son of Jozadak. “Brothers” could mean biological brothers, but it is more likely that it refers figuratively to relatives. Alternate translation: “from the descendants of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his relatives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 
EZR	10	18	pp5e	translate-names	מַֽעֲשֵׂיָה֙ וֶֽ⁠אֱלִיעֶ֔זֶר וְ⁠יָרִ֖יב וּ⁠גְדַלְיָֽה	1	Eliezer…Jarib	These are the names of four men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EZR	10	19	4u0s	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּתְּנ֥וּ	1	Eliezer…Jarib	This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “as a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EZR	10	19	w25u	translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּתְּנ֥וּ יָדָ֖⁠ם	1	Eliezer…Jarib	This means that the men shook hands with the clan leaders to signify that they were making a promise. Alternate translation: “they shook hands in pledge” or “they shook hands and promised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EZR	10	19	03eh	figs-explicit	לְ⁠הוֹצִ֣יא נְשֵׁי⁠הֶ֑ם וַ⁠אֲשֵׁמִ֥ים אֵֽיל־צֹ֖אן עַל־אַשְׁמָתָֽ⁠ם	1	Eliezer…Jarib	While the book does not specify that all the other men whose names are listed in the rest of this chapter had to make a similar pledge and pay a similar penalty, the implication is that the commission required these same things of all the offenders. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “that they would divorce their wives and send them away and that they would sacrifice a ram from their flocks as a guilt offering, since the clan leaders had found them guilty. The clan leaders made all the men who had married foreign wives do these same things.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	10	19	v518	figs-idiom	לְ⁠הוֹצִ֣יא נְשֵׁי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	Eliezer…Jarib	As in [10:3] (../10/03.md), “to cause to go out” is a Hebrew idiom that means to divorce and send away. Alternate translation: “that they would divorce their wives and send them away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EZR	10	19	i4ab	translate-names	וַ⁠אֲשֵׁמִ֥ים אֵֽיל־צֹ֖אן עַל־אַשְׁמָתָֽ⁠ם	1	Eliezer…Jarib	Here the book leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete.
