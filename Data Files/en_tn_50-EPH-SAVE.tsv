Wives and husbands; children and parents; slaves and masters (5:22-6:9)<br>1. Armor of God (6:10-20)<br>1. Final greeting (6:21-24)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Ephesians?<br><br>Paul wrote Ephesians. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>The Apostle Paul helped start the church in Ephesus on one of his trips. He also lived in Ephesus for a year and a half and helped the believers there. Paul probably wrote this letter while he was in prison in Rome.<br><br>### What is the Book of Ephesians about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to the Christians in Ephesus to explain God’s love for them in Christ Jesus. He described the blessings that God was giving them because they were now united with Christ. He explained that all believers are united together, whether Jew or Gentile. Paul also wanted to encourage them to live in a way that pleases God.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Ephesians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Ephesus” or “A Letter to the Christians in Ephesus.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What was the “mystery” in the Book of Ephesians?<br><br>The expression translated in the ULT as “mystery” or “hidden” occurs six times. By it Paul always meant something that God had to reveal to human beings because they could not know it on their own. It always referred to something about how God planned to save mankind. Sometimes it was about his plan to cause peace between himself and mankind. Sometimes it was more specifically about his plan to save both Jews and Gentiles by uniting them through Christ. This hidden truth was that Gentiles are now able to benefit from the promises of Christ as equals with the Jews.<br><br>### What did Paul say about salvation and righteous living?<br><br>Paul said much about salvation and righteous living in this letter and in many of his letters. He said that God has been very kind and saved Christians because they believe in Jesus. Therefore, after they become Christians, they should live in a righteous way to show that they have faith in Christ. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Singular and plural “you”<br><br>In this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. The word “you” is almost always plural and refers to the believers who may read this letter. The three exceptions to this are: 5:14, 6:2, and 6:3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>### What did Paul mean by the “new self” or the “new man”?<br><br>When Paul spoke of the “new self” or the “new man,” he meant the new nature that a believer receives from the Holy Spirit. This new nature was created in God’s image (See: 4:24). The phrase “new man” is also used for God causing peace between Jews and Gentiles. God brought them together as one people that belong to him (See: 2:15).<br><br>### How are the ideas of “holy” and “sanctify” represented in Ephesians in the ULT?<br><br>The scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:<br><br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the use of “holy” to express the fact that God views Christians as sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another use of “holy” is to express the idea that God is perfect and faultless. A third use is to express the idea that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless, faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses “holy,” “holy God,” “holy ones,” or “saints.” (See: 1:1, 4)<br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses “saint” or “saints.”<br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “set apart,” “dedicated to,” or “reserved for.” (See: 3:5)<br><br>The UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.<br><br>### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?<br><br>This kind of expression occurs in 1:1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 20; 2:6, 7, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22; 3:5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 21; 4:1, 17, 21, 32; 5:8, 18, 19; 6:1, 10, 18, 21. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union between Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Ephesians?<br><br>* “in Ephesus” (1:1). Some of the earliest manuscripts do not include this phrase. It is likely that Paul intended this letter to be read in many churches, including Ephesus and many other cities, as well. He may have originally left a blank space for the city name, to be filled in by those copying the letter and carrying it to different cities. But “Ephesus” is the only name found on manuscripts that have a city name. Therefore, the ULT, UST, and many modern versions include it.<br>* “because we are members of his body” (5:30). Most modern versions, including the ULT and UST, read in this way. Some older versions read, “because we are members of his body and of his bones.” Translators might decide to choose the second reading if other versions in their area have it that way. If translators choose the second reading, they should put the additional words inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to the Book of Ephesians.<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
EPH	1	intro	fg42			0		# Ephesians 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>### “I pray”<br><br>Paul structures part of this chapter like a prayer of praise to God. But Paul is not just talking to God. He is teaching the church in Ephesus. He also tells the Ephesians how he is praying for them.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Predestination<br>Many scholars believe this chapter teaches on a subject known as “predestination.” See the use of the word “predestine” in 1:5, 11. Some scholars take this to indicate that God has, from before the foundation of the world, chosen some people to eternally save. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject, so translators need to take extra care when translating this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]])

EPH	2	intro	e7qn			0		# Ephesians 02 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter focuses on the life that a Christian had before coming to believe in Jesus. Paul then uses this information to explain how a person’s former way of living is distinct from a Christian’s new identity “in Christ.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### One body<br>Paul teaches about the church in this chapter. The church is made of two different groups of people (Jews and Gentiles). They are now one group or “body.” The church is also known as the body of Christ. Jews and Gentiles are united in Christ.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### “Dead in trespasses and sins”<br>Paul teaches that those who are not Christians are “dead” in their sin. Sin binds or enslaves them. This makes them spiritually “dead.” Paul writes that God makes Christians alive in Christ. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### Descriptions of worldly living<br>Paul uses many different ways to describe how non-Christians act. They “lived according to the ways of this world” and are “living according to the ruler of the authorities of the air,” “fulfilling the evil desires of our sinful nature,” and “carrying out the desires of the body and of the mind.”<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “It is the gift of God”<br>Some scholars believe “it” here refers to being saved. Other scholars believe that it is faith that is the gift of God. Because of how the Greek tenses agree, “it” here probably refers to both things: the gift is that we are saved by God’s grace through faith.<br><br>### Flesh<br><br>“Flesh” is sometimes used as a metaphor for a person’s sinful nature.
