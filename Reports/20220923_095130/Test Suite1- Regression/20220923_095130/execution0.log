Greeting and prayer for the spiritual blessings in Christ (1:1-23)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Sin and salvation (2:1-10)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Unity and peace (2:11-22)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Mystery of Christ in the believers, made known (3:1-13)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Prayer for riches of his glory to make the believers strong (3:14-21)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Unity of the Spirit, building up the Body of Christ (4:1-16)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. New life (4:17-32)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Imitators of God (5:1-21)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. 1 Wives and husbands; children and parents; slaves and masters (5:22-6:9)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;11. Armor of God (6:10-20)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Final greeting (6:21-24)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the Book of Ephesians?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote Ephesians. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The Apostle Paul helped start the church in Ephesus on one of his trips. He also lived in Ephesus for a year and a half and helped the believers there. Paul probably wrote this letter while he was in prison in Rome.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the Book of Ephesians about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote this letter to the Christians in Ephesus to explain God’s love for them in Christ Jesus. He described the blessings that God was giving them because they were now united with Christ. He explained that all believers are united together, whether Jew or Gentile. Paul also wanted to encourage them to live in a way that pleases God.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Ephesians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Ephesus” or “A Letter to the Christians in Ephesus.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What was the “mystery” in the book of Ephesians?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The expression translated in the ULT as “mystery” or “hidden” occurs six times. By it, Paul always meant something that God had to reveal to human beings because they could not know it on their own. It always referred to something about how God planned to save mankind. Sometimes it was about his plan to bring about peace between himself and mankind. Sometimes it was more specifically about his plan to save both Jews and Gentiles by uniting them through Christ. This hidden truth was that Gentiles are now able to benefit from the promises of Christ as equals with the Jews.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What did Paul say about salvation and righteous living?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul said much about salvation and righteous living in this letter and in many of his letters. He said that God has been very kind and saved Christians because they believe in Jesus. Therefore, after they become Christians, they should live in a righteous way to show that they have faith in Christ. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Singular and plural “you”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. The word “you” is almost always plural and refers to the believers who may read this letter. The three exceptions to this are: 5:14, 6:2, and 6:3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What did Paul mean by the “new self” or the “new man”?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;When Paul spoke of the “new self” or the “new man,” he meant the new nature that a believer receives from the Holy Spirit. This new nature was created in God’s image (See: 4:24). The phrase “new man” is also used for God bringing about peace between Jews and Gentiles. God brought them together as one people group that belong to him (See: 2:15).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How are the ideas of “holy” and “sanctify” represented in Ephesians in the ULT?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The scriptures use such words to indicate any one of several ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the use of “holy” to express the fact that God views Christians as sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another use of “holy” is to express the idea that God is perfect and faultless. A third use is to express the idea that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless, faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses “holy,” “holy God,” “holy ones,” or “saints.” (See: 1:1, 4)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses “saint” or “saints.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “set apart,” “dedicated to,” or “reserved for.” (See: 3:5)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This kind of expression occurs in 1:1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 20; 2:6, 7, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22; 3:5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 21; 4:1, 17, 21, 32; 5:8, 18, 19; 6:1, 10, 18, 21. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union between Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Ephesians?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “in Ephesus” (1:1). Some of the earliest manuscripts do not include this phrase. It is likely that Paul intended this letter to be read in many churches, including Ephesus and many other cities. He may have originally left a blank space for the city name to be filled in by those copying the letter and carrying it to different cities. But “Ephesus” is the only name found on manuscripts that have a city name. Therefore, the ULT, UST, and many modern versions include it.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “because we are members of his body” (5:30). Most modern versions, including the ULT and UST, read in this way. Some older versions read, “because we are members of his body and of his bones.” Translators might decide to choose the second reading if other versions in their area have it that way. If translators choose the second reading, they should put the additional words inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to the book of Ephesians.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

But Paul is not just talking to God. He is teaching the church in Ephesus.

Some scholars take this to indicate that God has, from before the foundation of the world, chosen some people to save. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject, so translators need to take extra care when translating this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]])

EPH 2 intro e7qn   0  # Ephesians 2 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This chapter focuses on the life that a Christian had before coming to believe in Jesus. Paul then uses this information to explain how a person’s former way of living is distinct from a Christian’s new identity “in Christ.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### One body&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul teaches about the church in this chapter. The church is made of two different groups of people (Jews and Gentiles). They are now one group or “body.” The church is also known as the body of Christ. Jews and Gentiles are united in Christ.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Important figures of speech in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “Dead in trespasses and sins”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul teaches that those who are not Christians are “dead” in their sin. Sin binds or enslaves them. This makes them spiritually “dead.” Paul writes that God makes Christians alive in Christ. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Descriptions of worldly living&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul uses many different ways to describe how non-Christians act. They “lived according to the ways of this world” and are “living according to the ruler of the authorities of the air,” “fulfilling the evil desires of our sinful nature,” and “carrying out the desires of the body and of the mind.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “It is the gift of God”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Some scholars believe “it” here refers to being saved. Other scholars believe that it is faith that is the gift of God. Because of how the Greek tenses agree, “it” here probably refers to both things: the gift is that we are saved by God’s grace through faith.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Flesh&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;“Flesh” is sometimes used as a metaphor for a person’s sinful nature. The phrase “Gentiles in the flesh” indicates the Ephesians once lived without any concern for God. But “flesh” is also used in this verse to refer to the physical person, similar to “body part of man.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])

PHP front intro pv9j   0  # Introduction to Philippians&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 1: General Introduction&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Outline of the Book of the Philippians&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Greeting, thanksgiving and prayer (1:1-11)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Paul’s report on his ministry (1:12-26)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Instructions&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    - To be steadfast (1:27-30)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    - To be united (2:1-2)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    - To be humble (2:3-11)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    - To work out our salvation with God working in you (2:12-13)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    - To be innocent and light (2:14-18)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Timothy and Epaphroditus (2:19-30)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Warning about false teachers (3:1-4:1)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Personal instruction (4:2-5)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Rejoice and do not be anxious (4:4-6)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Final remarks&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    - Values (4:8-9)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    - Contentment (4:10-20)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    - Final Greetings (4:21-23)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the Book Philippians?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote Philippians. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote this letter while in prison in Rome.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the Book of Philippians about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote this letter to the believers in Philippi, a city in Macedonia. He wrote it to thank the Philippians for the gift they had sent him. He wanted to tell them about how he was doing in prison and to encourage them to rejoice even if they are suffering. He also wrote to them about a man named Epaphroditus. He was the one who brought the gift to Paul. While visiting Paul, Epaphroditus became ill. So, Paul decided to send him back to Philippi. Paul encouraged the believers in Philippi to welcome and to be kind to Epaphroditus when he returns.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Philippians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Philippi,” or “A Letter to the Christians in Philippi.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What was the city of Philippi like?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, founded Philippi in the region of Macedonia. This meant that the citizens of Philippi were also considered citizens of Rome. The people of Philippi were proud of being citizens of Rome. But Paul told the believers that it is much more important that they are citizens of heaven (3:20).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Singular and plural “you”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. The words “you” and “your” always refer to the believers in Philippi except for one time in 4:3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who were the “enemies of the cross of Christ” (3:18) in this letter?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The “enemies of the cross of Christ” were probably people who called themselves believers, but they did not obey God’s commands. They thought that freedom in Christ meant that believers could do whatever they desired and God would not punish them (3:19).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Why were the words “joy” and “rejoice” frequently used in this letter?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul was in prison when he wrote this letter (1:7). Even though he suffered, Paul said many times that he was joyful because God had been kind to him through Jesus Christ. He wanted to encourage his readers to have the same trust in Jesus Christ.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What does Paul mean by the expression “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This kind of expression occurs in 1:1, 8, 13, 14, 26, 27; 2:1, 5, 19, 24, 29; 3:1, 3, 9, 14; 4:1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 19, 21. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. See the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Philippians?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Some versions have “Amen” at the end of the final verse in the letter (4:23). The ULT, UST, and many other modern versions do not. If “Amen” is included, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of Philippians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
PHP 1 intro kd3g   0  # Philippians 1 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul follows the normal practice of the time by beginning the letter with a statement of the names of the senders and the recipients. In that culture, the sender would then offer a good wish for the recipients. Paul does this in the form of a Christian blessing.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### The day of Christ&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This refers to the day when Christ returns. Paul often connected the return of Christ with motivating godly living. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Paradox&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. This statement in verse 21 is a paradox: “to die is gain.” In verse 23 Paul explains why this is true. ([Philippians 1:21](../../php/01/21.md))

PHP 1 2 pyji figs-yousingular ὑμῖν 1  Here, **you** refers to the the Philippian Christians and is plural in form in the original language that Paul wrote this letter in. In this letter, with one exception, the words “you” and “your” are plural and refer to the Philippian Christians. If your language uses different forms to show when “you” and “your” refer to one person and when they refer to more than one person, use the plural form that would be appropriate in your language in this occurrence and all other occurrences of “you” and “your” in this letter, except for in [4:3](../04/3.md). A note will discuss the one exception in [4:3](../04/3.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
PHP 1 2 yh4s figs-exclusive Πατρὸς ἡμῶν 1  If your language has different forms for including or excluding the hearers, use the inclusive form for **our** here, and throughout the letter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
PHP 1 3 ntp5  ἐπὶ πάσῃ τῇ μνείᾳ ὑμῶν 1 in all my remembrance of you Here, **in all my remembrance of you** could refer to: (1) each time that Paul thought about the Philippian believers. Alternate translation: “each time that I think about you” (2) each time that Paul prayed for the Philippian believers. Alternate translation: “every time I pray for you”
PHP 1 3 gjyv figs-possession τῷ Θεῷ μου 1  This does not mean that God belongs to Paul, but that Paul belongs to God. That is, God is the one whom Paul worships exclusively. Alternate translation: “the one who is God to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
PHP 1 3 w8dz figs-yousingular ὑμῶν 1  See how you translated the word **you** in [1:2](../01/2.md). In this letter, every use of the words **you** and **your** are plural and refer to the Philippian believers except for one use in [4:3](../04/3.md) which has a note to discuss it.

A note will discuss the one exception in [4:3](../04/3.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
PHP 1 5 yi9l figs-explicit τῇ κοινωνίᾳ ὑμῶν εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον 1 because of your fellowship in the gospel Here, **your fellowship in the gospel** refers to the Philippians’ partnering with Paul in the various things involved in spreading the gospel. This includes gifts of money that they sent to Paul (see [4:15–18](../04/15.md). If it would be clearer in your language you can state this more explicitly. Alternate translation: “your participation with me in advancing the gospel” or “your partnership with me in working to spread the good news about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP 1 5 vi1r figs-explicit ἀπὸ τῆς πρώτης ἡμέρας 1  The phrase **from the first day** refers to the time at which the Philippian believers first believed the gospel that Paul preached to them. This may also have been the first day that Paul preached in Philippi. Alternate translation: “from the time you first heard and believed the gospel that I preached” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP 1 5 d8hi figs-explicit ἄχρι τοῦ νῦν 1  The phrase **until now** does not mean that the Philippian believers have now stopped partnering with Paul. Rather, it means that they are still partnering with Paul. Alternate translation: “that you are still doing now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP 1 6 s1l8 figs-explicit πεποιθὼς αὐτὸ τοῦτο 1 having been persuaded The phrase **having been persuaded** indicates a reason that Paul thanks God. If it would be clearer in your language you can state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I thank God because I am confident of this very thing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP 1 6 jf4x figs-explicit ὁ ἐναρξάμενος 1 the one having begun Here, **the one** refers to God. If it would be clearer in your language you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God having begun” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP 1 6 u80a figs-explicit ὅτι ὁ ἐναρξάμενος ἐν ὑμῖν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν 1  The phrase **good work in you** refers to both the initial conversion of the Philippian Christians and to God’s ongoing work in their lives through the Holy Spirit. If it would be clearer in your language you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “that God, having begun his good work in you through your conversion and continuing it through the work of the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP 1 6 qhmh figs-explicit ὑμῖν 1  See how you translated the word **you** in [Philippians 1:2](../01/2.md).
PHP 1 6 p2a5 figs-explicit ἐπιτελέσει 1  Here, **will perfect it** means that God will bring to completion the work which he began in the lives of the Philippian believers at their conversion and which he was continuing to do. If it would be clearer in your language you can say this explicitly. See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP 1 6 p5pu figs-explicit ἡμέρας Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ 1  The phrase **the day of Jesus Christ** refers to the time in the future when Jesus Christ will return to judge the world and save those who believe in him. If it would be clearer in your language you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the time when Jesus Christ returns” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP 1 7 sowf figs-idiom τὸ ἔχειν με ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμᾶς 1 I have you in my heart The phrase, **I have you in my heart** is an idiom which expresses strong affection. If you have an equivalent expression which adequately communicates the meaning you may use it here. If not, you can state this using plain language. Alternate translation: “I love you very much” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
PHP 1 7 jn2s  συνκοινωνούς μου τῆς χάριτος…ὄντας 1 being partakers with me of grace Alternate translation: “sharing in grace with me”
PHP 1 7 df00 figs-abstractnouns χάριτος 1  Here, **grace** refers to the way that God kindly gives us good things that we do not deserve. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **grace** with a verb or adjective. In this context, Paul considers both his imprisonment and his ministry of defending and confirming the gospel to be gifts from God. Alternate translation: “of God&amp;apos;s gracious gift” or “in experiencing how kind God is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHP 1 7 o7ef figs-metonymy δεσμοῖς μου 1  Paul refers to his imprisonment in Rome by using the phrase **my chains**. Paul was chained to a guard and the Philippian Christians would have understood that Paul was referring to his imprisonment when he used the phrase **my chains** because of the close association between **chains** and being in prison. If this association is not clear in your language you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language. Alternate translation: “my imprisonment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
PHP 1 7 wey7 figs-doublet καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀπολογίᾳ καὶ βεβαιώσει τοῦ εὐαγγελίου 1  At the time that Paul wrote this letter, the words translated **defense** and **confirmation** could be used to refer to defending and confirming the truth of something in a court of law against a charge that was made. These two words mean very similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize that this is hard work. If your language has one word for these ideas, use that here, and add emphasis another way. If there is a word or phrase that could be used with this legal sense but could also be used in the context of defending the gospel, consider using it here. Alternate translation: “and as I contend for the truth of the gospel” or “and as I labor to show people that the gospel is true” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
PHP 1 8 xun1 figs-idiom ἐν σπλάγχνοις Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ 1 in the bowels of Christ Jesus The word translated **inner parts** is a term which refers to body organs and particularly to the intestines, liver, lungs, and heart. Here, Paul uses **inner parts** figuratively to refer to love or affection. You can use the body part that represents the seat of affection in your language, or translate the plain meaning. Alternate translation: “with the heart of Christ Jesus” or “with the affection of Christ Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
PHP 1 8 bo0r  ἐν σπλάγχνοις Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ 1 in the bowels of Christ Jesus Here, **the inner parts of Christ Jesus** could mean: (1) the same kind of love as Christ Jesus gives to people. See the UST. (2) love that originates with Christ Jesus. Alternate translation: “with love that comes from Christ Jesus”
PHP 1 9 w910 figs-abstractnouns ἐν ἐπιγνώσει καὶ πάσῃ αἰσθήσει 1  The word **knowledge** is an abstract noun. If it would be clearer in your language you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **knowledge** with a verb such as “see”. Alternate translation: “and that God will enable you to see the truth about Him and teach you to love wisely” See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHP 1 9 jlyu figs-abstractnouns ἵνα ἡ ἀγάπη ὑμῶν ἔτι μᾶλλον καὶ μᾶλλον περισσεύῃ 1  If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **love** with the verb form. Alternate translation: “that you will be able to love others more and more abundantly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHP 1 9 f4q5  ὑμῶν 1  See how you translated the word **your** in [Philippians 1:5](../01/5.md).
PHP 1 9 tbtt figs-abstractnouns ἐν ἐπιγνώσει καὶ πάσῃ αἰσθήσει 1  If it would be clearer in your language you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **knowledge** and **understanding** with verb phrases. Alternate translation: “and that God will enable you to see the truth about Him and teach you to love wisely” See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHP 1 10 e17g figs-explicit εἰς τὸ δοκιμάζειν ὑμᾶς τὰ διαφέροντα 1  The word **what** here refers to what a person does, and the word **excels** here refers to something that is the best according to God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say these things explicitly. Alternate translation: “so that you may approve and choose to do what pleases God the most” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP 1 10 ybw6 grammar-connect-logic-result εἰς 1  Here, the phrase **so that** shows that what follows this phrase is the desired result of Paul&amp;apos;s prayer in verse nine. Consider using a connecting word or phrase that will clearly show that what follows it is the desired result of what Paul prayed in verse nine. See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
PHP 1 10 siv8 figs-doublet εἰλικρινεῖς καὶ ἀπρόσκοποι 1 pure and blameless The words **pure** and **blameless** have very similar meanings. Paul uses these two words together to emphasize the idea of moral purity. If it would be clearer in your language you could combine these two words and translate them as one idea. Alternate translation: “completely blameless” or see UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
PHP 1 11 lu5n figs-metaphor πεπληρωμένοι καρπὸν δικαιοσύνης τὸν 1  Here, the phrase **being filled with** is a metaphor meaning to be occupied in doing something. The phrase **the fruit of righteousness** is a metaphor which figuratively refers to what characterizes a person, namely what a person produces. This metaphor is a comparison between a good tree that produces good fruit and a person who is filled with righteousness and produces good actions as a result. So with these two metaphors, Paul is telling the Philippians to be occupied in doing righteous deeds. If this would be unclear in your language you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: “filling your lives with the righteous deeds that are” or “habitually doing the good works that are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHP 1 11 t3w4 figs-activepassive πεπληρωμένοι 1  The phrase **being filled with** is a passive form. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “letting God fill you with” or “continually producing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
PHP 1 11 yq99 figs-metaphor τὸν διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ 1  Here, the phrase **through Christ Jesus** is a metaphor meaning that Christ Jesus is the one who makes it possible for a person to be righteous and thus to do the things that a righteous person does. Alternate translation: “that Christ Jesus produces in you” or “that Christ Jesus enables you to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHP 1 11 jwgb figs-abstractnouns εἰς δόξαν καὶ ἔπαινον Θεοῦ 1  If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **glory** and **praise** with verbs. Alternate translation: “which will cause people to glorify and praise God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHP 1 11 mfs6 figs-doublet εἰς δόξαν καὶ ἔπαινον Θεοῦ 1  The words **glory** and **praise** mean very similar things here. They are used together to emphasize how much people will praise God. If you have one word for this in your language, you can use it here and show emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “which will cause people to greatly praise God” or “which will cause people to keep saying how great God is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
PHP 1 12 tu2t figs-gendernotations ἀδελφοί 1 brothers Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a spiritual sense to include both men and women who believe in Jesus. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” or see UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
PHP 1 12 ygt3 figs-metaphor ἀδελφοί 1 brothers Paul is using the term **brother** figuratively here to refer to anyone who is a fellow believer in Jesus. If this is not clear in your language, you can express this plainly. Alternative translation, “my companions who believe in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHP 1 12 zy4g figs-explicit τὰ κατ’ ἐμὲ 1 the things concerning me The phrase **the things concerning me** refers to Paul’s imprisonment. If it would be clearer in your language, you can state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the things I have suffered because I was put into prison for preaching about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP 1 12 q288 figs-metaphor μᾶλλον εἰς προκοπὴν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου ἐλήλυθεν 1 have really happened for the advancement of the gospel The phrase **advancement of the gospel** figuratively refers to an increasing number of people hearing and believing the gospel. Alternate translation: “have actually caused more people to hear the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHP 1 13 wi6n grammar-connect-logic-result ὥστε 1 my chains in Christ became apparent among the whole palace guard and all the others Here, the phrase **As a result** shows that what follows this phrase is the result of Paul’s circumstances which he began discussing in verse 12, namely, his imprisonment. Consider using a connecting word or phrase that will clearly show that what follows it is the result of Paul’s imprisonment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
PHP 1 13 h1ly figs-metonymy δεσμούς μου 1 my chains in Christ became apparent Paul again refers to his imprisonment in a figurative way by using the phrase **my chains**. See how you translated this phrase in [1:7](../01/7.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
PHP 1 13 f8az figs-explicit τοὺς δεσμούς μου…ἐν Χριστῷ 1 my chains in Christ Here, the phrase **my chains in Christ** means that Paul is imprisoned because of his work for the cause of Christ. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “my chains for the sake of Christ” or “my chains because I teach people about Christ” or “my chains for the cause of Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP 1 13 dm1m figs-metonymy πραιτωρίῳ 1 the whole palace guard The word **praetorium** refers to the place where a special group of soldiers stayed that protected the Roman emperor and his representatives. Here, Paul uses the name of the place to refer to the soldiers that stayed there. Consider translating this phrase in a way that is easily understood in your language. Alternate translation: “palace guard” or “company of palace soldiers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
PHP 1 14 a1kh  ἀδελφῶν 1  See how you translated **brothers** in the previous verse [1:12](../01/12.md).  
PHP 1 14 eurs figs-metaphor ἀδελφῶν 1  Paul is using the term **brother** figuratively here to refer to anyone who is a fellow believer in Jesus.

Paul uses these two phrases together to emphasize how hard he has worked to help people believe in Christ and mature in their obedience and love for him. You may translate theses two phrases separately, as the ULT does, or if it would be clearer in your language you may translate them together as a single phrase. Alternate translation: “I did not work so hard for nothing” or “I did not work hard with no lasting results” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
PHP 2 16 m1z7 figs-metaphor οὐκ εἰς κενὸν ἔδραμον 1 I did … run Here, Paul uses the word **run** metaphorically to mean “work”. Here, Paul specifically means “work for the advancement of the gospel” among the Philippians. Paul uses the word **run** to bring to the Philippians mind the image of a runner who is running in a race toward a finish line in order to win a prize. If this is familiar to people in your culture consider using this metaphor but if this image is not familiar to your readers  consider stating this idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “I did not work for the advancement of the gospel uselessly” or “I did not work for the spread of the good news for nothing” or “I did not run the race uselessly”( See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

PHP 2 16 btgu figs-explicit οὐδὲ εἰς κενὸν ἐκοπίασα 1  Here, Paul uses the word **labor** to refer to his spiritual work of sharing the gospel with the Philippian believers and working to help them grow in spiritual maturity. Paul assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to his spiritual work among them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.

PHP 2 17 j2ov translate-symaction σπένδομαι ἐπὶ τῇ θυσίᾳ καὶ λειτουργίᾳ τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν 1  The phrase **I am being poured out as an offering on the sacrifice** uses imagery from the Old Testament Jewish sacrificial system. A priest would sacrifice an animal on the altar as a burnt offering to God and then pour out wine as a drink offering to God. The priest poured wine on the sacrifice in order to make the sacrifice complete. See [Num 28:7](num 28:7). If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, consider using it here, but if this imagery would be confusing in your culture consider translating this imagery using plain language.

PHP 2 17 xlv0 figs-metaphor σπένδομαι 1  Paul uses the phrase **I am being poured out as an offering** to figuratively depict his imprisonment and suffering to advance the gospel. Paul probably is also thinking of the fact that he could potentially be killed in the future for preaching the gospel.

PHP 2 25 csw5 figs-metaphor ἀδελφὸν…μου 1  Here, the phrase **my brother** does not mean that Epaphroditus was Paul’s biological brother. Rather, Paul calls Epaphroditus his **brother** because they were both members of God’s spiritual family through their faith in Jesus Christ.

PHP 2 25 c3ce figs-metaphor συνστρατιώτην 1 fellow worker and fellow soldier Here, the phrase **fellow soldier** does not mean that Epaphroditus and Paul were actual soldiers in a military. What Paul means is that he and Epaphroditus were spiritual soldiers fighting together for God in the spiritual battle against Satan and evil. If this would be unclear in your language you could express this explicitly or modify the phrase **fellow soldier** to further explain what Paul means here.

In every way, Paul was an exemplary Jew. But he contrasts this with the greatness of knowing Jesus.

PHP 3 2 zin8  τοὺς κύνας…τοὺς κακοὺς ἐργάτας…τὴν κατατομήν 1 the dogs … the evil workers … the mutilation The phrases **the dogs**, **the evil workers**, and **the mutilation** are three different ways of describing the same group of Jewish teachers who were corrupting the gospel. Paul uses strong expressions to convey his feeling about these Jewish teachers.
PHP 3 2 yeax translate-unknown τοὺς κύνας 1 the dogs Paul speaks of the Jewish teachers who were corrupting the gospel as though they were **dogs** in order to show strong contempt for them. A dog is an animal that is common in many parts of the world. Dogs are despised in some cultures but not despised in other cultures so using the term **dogs** in some cultures may not have the derogatory meaning that Paul intended. If you have a different animal in your culture that is despised or whose name is used as an insult, you could use this animal instead if it would fit well in this context. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
PHP 3 2 i40z  βλέπετε 2  See how you translated the phrase **beware of** earlier in this verse.

PHP 3 2 vc2u translate-unknown τὴν κατατομήν 1  The word **mutilation** is a sarcastic way of referring to circumcision and **the mutilation** is a sarcastic way of referring to those who taught that circumcision was necessary in order to be in right standing with God. At the time Paul wrote this letter it was a common practice for those who practiced false religions to cut themselves in order to try to earn favor from their god. By using the term **mutilation**, Paul is showing the Philippian believers that those who trust in circumcision, and not solely in Christ, are like pagan false worshipers who mistakenly think that they can earn God’s favor by cutting their bodies. Consider the term that would best communicate this idea in your language. Alternate translation: “those who cut themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
PHP 3 2 x8r2 figs-metonymy τὴν κατατομήν 1 the mutilation Here, **the mutilation** refers to the Jewish teachers who were all circumcised and were corrupting the gospel by teaching that it was necessary to be circumcised. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
PHP 3 3 y8yt figs-exclusive ἡμεῖς γάρ ἐσμεν 1 For we are Here, Paul uses **we** to refer to himself and all true believers in Christ, including the Philippian believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
PHP 3 3 xt5r  ἡ περιτομή 1 the circumcision Here, the term **the circumcision** is used metonymously to refer to all true Christians. Here, Paul is using this term in contrast to its normal usage in the Bible. Normally the term **the circumcision** was used to refer to Jewish males since all Jewish males were circumcised at this time. Here, Paul intentionally uses this term in a way that would have been surprising to his readers. Here, Paul uses this term with a spiritual sense to refer to all Christians, both Jews and non-Jews. Paul uses the term **the circumcision** here, to refer to the inward, spiritual circumcision that the Holy Spirit performs in the hearts of all true Christians. Paul discusses this spiritual circumcision in [Romans 11:21–24](../11/21-24.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

PHP 3 3 k8ph figs-ellipsis οὐκ ἐν σαρκὶ πεποιθότες 1 having no confidence in the flesh Here, the phrase **confidence in the flesh** is leaving out some implied words that would need to be supplied in some languages in order to make this idea complete. Paul is leaving out the words “works of the” in this phrase and means **having no confidence in the works of the flesh**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could supply these words which are implied from the context. Alternate translation: “having no confidence in the works of the flesh” or “not trusting that circumcision will please God” “not trusting that circumcision will earn God’s favor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
PHP 3 3 nkrs  καυχώμενοι ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐν σαρκὶ πεποιθότες 1  The phrase **boasting in Christ Jesus** and the phrase **and having no confidence in the flesh** are complementary ideas which express a similar truth. If a person truly places their confidence in Christ as their only means of earning God’s favor they will not put their confidence in themself or religious acts and conversely if a person puts their confidence in religious rituals and observances they cannot place their full confidence in Christ. Consider the best way to clearly express the coordinate ideas in your language. See UST.

If anyone else seems to have confidence in the flesh, I even more Beginning with the phrase **if anyone**, Paul explains why, if anyone has a reason to be confident in religious works, he does. Beginning with this phrase, and continuing through the end of [3:6](../03/6.md), Paul gives his religious credentials and accomplishments in order to make the point that if earning God’s favor should be sought by observing the law then he had reason to boast more than anyone because. However, this is a hypothetical situation and Paul does not think that the Philippian believers should trust in keeping the law but rather in Christ.

These terms were used to describe things a business person determined to be either profitable or unprofitable. Here, Paul is using these two terms metaphorically to portray the things he considers spiritually profitable and unprofitable. If your language has similar business or accounting terms that would be natural to use in this context, consider using them here. Alternate translation: “Whatever things I formerly counted as gains, these things I now count as loss for the sake of Christ” or “Whatever things I formerly accounted as gains, these things I now account as loss for the sake of Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

In the original language that Paul wrote this letter in the term **dung** was a crude term that referred to things that were discarded as garbage including dung and the specific meaning was determined by context. Here, this word could be referring to: (1) excrement, since in the preceding verses Paul has been discussing what comes from the flesh. Alternate translation: “excrement” or “crap” (2) garbage, since Paul is discussing what he now considers worth throwing away in order to gain and know Christ.

In this verse Paul says that his **goal**, which he works hard for, is to win the **prize** which God promises to give every person who obediently follows Christ. If this metaphor would be unfamiliar in your culture consider using another metaphor or use plain language to translate the idea behind this metaphor. Alternate translation: “I do all I can to pursue the goal of winning the prize of God’s upward call in Christ Jesus” or “I work hard so that I can reach my goal of receiving God’s reward which he gives to all those who obey his upward call in Christ Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

PHP 4 18 fs44  ἀπέχω…πάντα 1 I have everything in full This could mean: (1) Paul has received **everything** that the Philippians sent. (2) Paul is using humor to continue the business metaphor from [Philippians 3:8](../03/08.md) and saying that this part of the letter is a receipt for commercial goods that Epaphroditus delivered.
PHP 4 18 en6t figs-explicit περισσεύω 1 I abound Paul means that he has plenty of the things that he needs for himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP 4 18 s68v figs-metaphor ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας, θυσίαν δεκτήν, εὐάρεστον τῷ Θεῷ 1 an aroma, a sweet smell, an acceptable, pleasing sacrifice to God Paul speaks of the gift from the Philippian church as if it were a **sacrifice** offered to **God** on an altar. Paul implies that the church’s gift is very **pleasing** to God, like the sacrifices that the priests burned, which had a **smell** that pleased God. Alternate translation: “I assure you these gifts are very pleasing to God, like an acceptable sacrifice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHP 4 19 r96p figs-idiom πληρώσει πᾶσαν χρείαν ὑμῶν 1 will fulfill all your needs The word for **will fulfill** is the same word translated as “have been fulfilled” in verse 18. This phrase is an idiom meaning “will provide everything you need” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
PHP 4 19 xmk2  κατὰ τὸ πλοῦτος αὐτοῦ ἐν δόξῃ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ 1 according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus “from his glorious riches that he gives through Christ Jesus”
PHP 4 20 fba5  τῷ δὲ Θεῷ…ἡμῶν 1 Now to our God The word **Now** marks the closing prayer and the end of this section of the letter.
PHP 4 21 h2jr  οἱ…ἀδελφοί 1 The brothers This refers to those people who were either ministering with or to Paul.
PHP 4 21 z65a  ἀδελφοί 1 brothers See how you translated this in [Philippians 1:12](../01/12.md).
PHP 4 22 rg96  μάλιστα…οἱ ἐκ τῆς Καίσαρος οἰκίας 1 especially those from the household of Caesar This refers to servants who worked in Caesar’s palace. “especially the fellow believers who work in the palace of Caesar”
PHP 4 23 a3f8 figs-synecdoche μετὰ τοῦ πνεύματος ὑμῶν 1 be with your spirit Paul refers to the believers by using the word **spirit,** which is what enables humans to relate to God. Alternate translation: “be with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])&amp;apos;</message>

Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee, and he persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus. However, he had never met the Colossians in person (see [2:1](../02/01.md)).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote this letter while in prison ([4:3](../04/03.md); [4:18](../04/18.md)). Paul was imprisoned many times, and he does not say where he is. Many scholars think he is in Rome.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the Book of Colossians about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote this letter to the believers in city of Colossae, which is in Asia Minor (modern Turkey). When he heard from Epaphras about the believers in Colossae, he wrote to encourage them and to warn them against false teachers. These false teachers were telling people that they had to obey certain rules and know certain things to receive new life, and they boasted about their own power and experiences. Paul attacks this false teaching by showing the Colossians that Christ’s work accomplishes everything that they need and gives them new life. When they are united to Christ, they do not need anything else, including this false teaching.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Colossians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Colossae” or “A Letter to the Christians in Colossae.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who were the false teachers that Paul warns the Colossians against?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Most likely, these false teachers were not part of one specific group or belief system. They probably believed and practiced things from several different belief systems. Because of this, it is hard to describe exactly what they believed and taught. Based on what Paul says about them, they had certain rules about food and drink, the calendar, and behavior; they had what Paul calls a “philosophy,” or a system of thinking about the word that they found sophisticated and that probably included the idea of “fullness”; and they based at least some of these beliefs and rules on visions and marvelous experiences that probably included encounters with angels. Paul argues that the people who hold to these views are not remaining faithful to Christ, and he wants the Colossians to focus on the work of Christ for them, which has accomplished everything this false teaching claims to do and more.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What does Paul mean when he uses language for “heaven”?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul speaks of heaven as “above,” and he further defines it as the place where Christ is seated at God’s right hand and where blessings are stored up for believers. Most likely, the spiritual powers are also in heaven. When Paul tells the Colossians to focus on what is “above” ([3:1](../03/01.md)), that is not because heaven is good and earth is bad. Instead, it is because heaven is where Christ is, as he states in the same verse. The Colossians are supposed to focus on Christ and where he is.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What are the spiritual powers that Paul speaks about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul speaks of thrones, dominions, governments, and authorities in [1:16](../01/16.md), and he uses some of these words again in [2:10](../02/10.md); [2:15](../02/15.md). These words refer to people or things that have power and authority, and in Colossians they probably refer more specifically to powerful spiritual beings. The “elemental principles” in [2:8](../02/08.md); [2:20](../02/20.md) probably refer to the same kind of beings in a generic way. Paul never specifically says that these spiritual powers are evil, but he does say that Christ’s work frees the Colossians from them. Obeying these powers and focusing on them is thus opposed to the new life that Christ has given.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who are all the people that Paul mentions in the letter?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Most of the people who are mentioned at the end of the letter are either with Paul or are people that Paul knows in or near the city of Colossae. Epaphras is mentioned several times, since he is the one who first preached the good news to the Colossians and the one who told Paul about them. Tychicus and Onesimus are the ones who traveled from Paul to Colossae with the letter, and they are able to give more updates about Paul and the people with him.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Why does Paul mention other towns in this letter?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul mentions Laodicea and Hierapolis because they are towns nearby in the same valley. If a person stood in Colossae, he or she could see Laodicea at the edge of the valley. Paul mentions these three towns (Colossae, Laodicea, and Hierapolis) because they were towns where Epaphras preached the good news, and Paul had never met any Christians in these places. Perhaps it is because of these similarities and because they were so close together that Paul wanted the Colossians and the Laodiceans to share their letters.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How does Paul identify Jesus as God?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul calls Jesus the “image” of God and the “firstborn” of all creation ([1:15](../01/15.md)). Neither of these descriptions are meant to describe Jesus as the first or best thing God created; instead, they put him outside the creation. This is clear from the next verse, which identifies him as creator ([1:16](../01/16.md)). If Jesus is not created, he is God. Being “before all things” and having “all things hold together” in him are statements that make the same affirmation ([1:17](../01/17.md)).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul twice describes Jesus as having the “fullness” of God ([1:19](../01/19.md); [2:9](../02/09.md)). This does not mean that Jesus was particularly close with God or had God living inside him. Instead, it means that Jesus is everything that God is (the “fullness” of God).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Finally, Jesus is seated at God’s right hand in heaven ([3:1](../03/01.md)). This does not mean he is a powerful figure who obeys God. Instead, it means that he sits on the divine throne and is God.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How does Paul identify Jesus as human?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul says that Jesus died in “the body of his flesh” ([1:22](../01/22.md)). Additionally, when he states that Jesus is the “fullness” of God, this is true of him “bodily” ([2:9](../02/09.md)). When Paul says that Jesus has a “body,” this does not mean that Jesus simply used a body to look human. Instead, he means that Jesus is an embodied human like us.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What does Paul mean when he tells the Colossians they have died and come back to life?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Multiple times throughout the letter, Paul tells the Colossians that they have died and risen with Christ. This does not mean that the Colossians have physically died and then returned from the dead. This language also is not just a figure of speech that Paul does not really mean. Rather, he means that God included believers with Christ when he died and resurrected. While the Colossians had not yet physically died and been resurrected, they could already experience death to the world and its powers and new life with its blessings because of their union with Christ in his death and resurrection.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What does Paul mean when he talks about knowledge?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul uses knowledge language throughout his letter, including words such as “knowing,” “knowledge,” and “understanding.” Perhaps the false teachers promised “knowledge” of God and his will to those who listened to them, and Paul intended to show the Colossians that all the knowledge they needed could be found in Christ and his work. Whether this is true or not, Paul does clearly intend to tell the Colossians that growing in their knowledge of God is important, and that this knowledge can be found in Christ. “Knowledge” refers to learning more about God, his will, and his work in the world, and “knowing” these things leads to new life and changed behavior.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Colossians?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;For the following verses, there are differences between some of the ancient manuscripts. The ULT text follows the reading that most scholars consider to be original and puts the other reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the language of wider communication in the region, translators may want to consider using the reading found in that version. If not, translators are advised to follow the reading in the ULT.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” ([1:2](../01/02.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “Grace to you, and peace from God our Father.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf” ([1:7](../01/07.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on your behalf.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “the Father, who has made you able to share the inheritance of the saints in the light” ([1:12](../01/12.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “the Father, who has made us able to share the inheritance of the saints in the light.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins” ([1:14](../01/14.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “having forgiven us all of our trespasses” ([2:13](../02/13.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “having forgiven you all of your trespasses.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “When Christ, your life, is revealed” ([3:4](../03/04.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “When Christ, our life, is revealed.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “the wrath of God is coming” ([3:6](../03/06.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “so that you might know the things concerning us” ([4:8](../04/08.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “so that he might know the things concerning you.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
COL 1 intro gtm3   0  # Colossians 1 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Letter Opening (1:1–12)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Greeting (1:1–2)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Prayer of Thanksgiving (1:3–8)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Prayer of Petition (1:9–12)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Teaching Section (1:13–2:23)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Christ and His Work (1:13–20)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Christ’s Work Applied to the Colossians (1:21–23)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Paul&amp;apos;s Ministry (1:24–2:5)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul begins this letter in [1:1–2](../01/01.md) by giving his and Timothy’s names, identifying the people to whom he is writing, and offering a greeting. This is the way people typically began letters at this time.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Mystery&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul refers to a “mystery” for the first time in this chapter ([1:26–27](../01/26.md)). This does not refer to some secret truth that is hard to understand and that only a few privileged individuals can learn about. Instead, it refers to God’s plans that once were unknown but are now known to all his people. What is the content of this mystery? It is Christ himself, his work, and his union with believers. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Fullness&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul refers to “filling” or “fullness” four times in this chapter. First, Paul prays that the Colossians are “filled” with the knowledge of God’s will ([1:9](../01/09.md)). Second, Jesus has all the “fullness” of God ([1:19](../01/19.md)). Third, Paul “fills up” in his flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ ([1:24](../01/24.md)). Fourth, Paul makes the word of God “fully” known ([1:25](../01/25.md)). It is possible that Paul uses “filling” and “fullness” so often because it was something that the false teachers promised. Paul wishes to show instead how “fullness” comes through the work of Christ and through his own work on their behalf. Christ has God’s fullness, and Paul works for Christ by “filling” the Colossians, who then are “filled” with the knowledge of God’s will.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Important figures of speech in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Images for Christian living&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul uses many different images to describe Christian living. In this chapter, he uses the images of “walking” and “bearing fruit” ([1:10](../01/10.md)). These images show that Paul wants the Colossians to think about the Christian life as a directed towards a goal (either a destination, if one is walking, or fruit, if one is growing). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Light versus Dark&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul contrasts the “inheritance of the saints in the light” ([1:12](../01/12.md)) with the “authority of the darkness” ([1:12](../01/12.md)). The “light” describes what is good, desirable, and related to God’s favor. The “darkness” is describes what is distant from God, opposed to him, and evil.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Head and Body&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this chapter, Paul introduces an image that he will develop more fully in chapter 2: that of Christ as the head of the body, which is his church. This image identifies Christ as the source of life and direction for his church, just like the head is the source of life and direction for the body.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### The Lack of the Afflictions of Christ&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [1:24](../01/24.md), Paul speaks of “the lack of the afflictions of Christ,” a lack that he fills up by his sufferings. This does not mean that Christ somehow failed in his mission and work, and Paul has to fill in the missing pieces. Instead, “lack” refers to something that Christ intentionally left for this followers to complete. He has called them to suffer, just as he himself did, to continue the mission of the church.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### The “Christ-Hymn”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Many scholars think that [1:15–20](../01/15.md) is an early Christian hymn that Paul has quoted to remind the Colossians of what they believe in common with other Christians. If this is true, it does not mean that this section says something different than what Paul thinks. Instead, Paul chose to quote it because he fully affirmed it. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could format these verses in a way that shows that they are from a hymn or poem.

Instead, the **lack** refers to what Christ wished for his disciples to do as his servants. The **lack**, then, is something that Christ intentionally did not accomplish because he wanted Paul to do it.

This does not mean that it is hard to understand but rather that it had not yet been revealed. Now, however, Paul says that it “has been revealed.” If it is not clear in your language to speak of a **mystery** that is revealed, you could replace **mystery** with a short descriptive phrase.

COL 1 29 ejqu figs-metaphor κοπιῶ, ἀγωνιζόμενος 1  Here, Paul uses two words to describe how hard he works. The first, **labor**, means to “work hard” or “strive.” The second, **striving**, is usually used for attempting to win a contest, whether that is athletic, military, or legal. While Paul is not actually participating in an athletic or military contest, he uses the metaphor to explain how hard he works towards his goal.

COL 2 intro p3uc   0  # Colossians 2 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and Formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Teaching Section (1:13–2:23)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Paul&amp;apos;s Ministry (1:24–2:5)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Effects of Christ’s Work (2:6–15)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Freedom in Christ (2:16–23)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Philosophy&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul speaks of “philosophy” in [2:8](../02/08.md). He is not referring to all attempts by humans to understand the world around them. Instead, he makes it clear that he is referring to thinking that is “empty” and full of “deceit,” that comes from traditions of humans and the “elemental principles.” All this “philosophy” is bad because it is not “according to Christ.” The “philosophy” that Paul attacks, then, is any attempt to make sense of the world that does not do so in line with Christ and his work.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Fullness&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Just as in the last chapter, “fullness” is an important idea that Paul refers to [2:9–10](../02/9.md). Again, Christ has the divine “fullness,” and he “fills” the Colossians. No other source of “fullness” is needed.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Important figures of speech in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Head and Body&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;As in the last chapter, Christ is called the “head,” both of powerful rulers ([2:10](../02/10.md)) and of his church [2:19](../02/19.md). Paul uses this language to identify Christ as the supreme ruler, just as the head rules over the body, and the source of life for the church, just as a body is dead without its head. Paul also identifies the church as the body of Christ in [2:19](../02/19.md). Here, his point is that the church cannot survive and grow without being connected to Christ, just as a body does not live or grow without a head. Finally, Paul refers to a “body” in [2:17](../02/17.md), but here the metaphor is different. The word “body” refers to any object that can cast a shadow (not primarily to an organic, human body) and here the “body” (the object) is Christ, who casts a shadow, which is identified as old covenant regulations.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Circumcision and baptism&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [2:11–13](../02/11.md), Paul uses the old covenant sign of circumcision to refer to removing the “the body of flesh” and the new covenant sign of baptism to refer to “being buried” with Christ. He uses these two signs to show how Christians are united with Christ, freed from sin, and given new life.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Flesh&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In Colossians, Paul uses “flesh” to refer to human existence in the world before resurrection and the new heavens and earth. He uses “flesh” neutrally to refer to physical presence in [2:1](../02/01.md); [2:5](../02/05.md). In many other places, however, he uses “flesh” to refer to the weakness and sinfulness of humans as they live in ways that fit with this broken world ([2:11](../02/11.md), [13](../02/13.md), [18](../02/18.md), [23](../02/23.md)). Often, “flesh” in these situations is translated with something like “sinful nature.” However, it is perhaps better to emphasize both weakness and sinfulness, and the term “nature” can be confusing. For examples of some ways to translate “flesh,” see the UST and notes in this chapter.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### The false teaching&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this chapter, Paul gives some information about what the false teachers are saying and doing. However, it is not enough to give us a full picture of who they were and what they taught. What is clear is that they spoke about extraordinary experiences, were interested in spiritual beings, and gave commands about behavior that at least sometimes were related to Old Testament law. If possible, keep your translation as vague as Paul’s own description of the false teachers.

Just as in that verse, it is usually used for striving to win a contest, whether athletic, legal, or military, and Paul uses the word here to indicate how much he cares for the Colossians and how hard he works for them.

This metaphor fits with the “judging” language in [2:16](../02/16.md). These two verses together suggest that the Colossians are tempted to choose the false teachers as their judges instead of Christ.

This means that, in their union with Christ, believers share in his death so that they too have died in a way.

It is only if one values these things that the commands have wisdom.

These terms refer to the person before (“old”) and after (“new”) dying and rising with Christ. With these key words, Paul makes a similar claim to what he argued in [2:11–13](../02/11–13.md): believers are not who they used to be; rather, they have received new life in Christ and are new people. Your translation should reflect the idea that Paul tells the Colossians that they are new people in their union with Christ.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### The wrath of God&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [3:6](../03/06.md), Paul speaks of the “wrath of God,” which is “coming.” God’s “wrath” is not primarily an emotion but rather his act of judgment on those who do not believe and who disobey. It is “coming” because God will act in judgment soon. In your translation, emphasize God’s act over his emotion.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### No Greek and Jew…&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [3:11](../03/11.md), Paul refers to multiple different ways to categorize people in his world. See the notes on that verse for details. Paul says that none of these categories exist in the “new man.” By this, he means that these categories are not relevant for those who have died and risen with Christ. It is one’s status as a “new” person that is relevant and important.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Important figures of speech in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Christ, your life&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [3:4](../03/04.md), Paul identifies Christ as the Colossians’ “life.” This metaphor comes from the previous verse, where Paul says that the Colossians’ life is “hidden with Christ.” Since their life is in Christ, Christ can be called their life. To say this a different way, the Colossians only have life in Christ, so their life and Christ’s life are bound together.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Avoiding vices, pursuing virtues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In his exhortation to the Colossians to avoid vices and pursue virtues, Paul uses a number of metaphors. For avoiding vices, he uses the language of “putting to death” ([3:5](../03/05.md)), “laying aside” ([3:8](../03/08.md)), and “taking off” ([3:9](../03/09.md)). All these metaphors require separation from vices, whether that is pictured as putting to death parts of the body that pursue vices or as taking off evil desires as if they were clothing. For pursuing virtues, he opposes “taking off” with “putting on” ([3:10](../03/10.md); [3:12](../03/12.md)). Just as the Colossians should “take off” the desire to pursue vices, they should “put on” the desire to pursue virtues. These metaphors are all intended to help the Colossians pursue virtue instead of vice.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Vice and virtue lists&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [3:5](../03/05.md) and [3:8](../03/08.md), Paul gives lists of vices. These lists are not meant to provide a complete catalog of immoral and evil behaviors. Instead, they provide some examples that are meant to show the Colossians the sort of things that Paul has in mind. In [3:12](../03/12.md), he provides a corresponding list of virtues. The same thinking applies here: this is not a complete catalog of correct or good behavior but instead gives examples of the kinds of things that Paul wants the Colossians to do. You could introduce these lists as examples if it would help your readers understand. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### The “household code”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [3:18](../03/18.md)–[4:1](../04/01.md), Paul uses a form that was well-known in his culture. It is often called a “household code,” and it consists of a list of instructions to different members of the household, including parents, children, slaves, and others. Paul uses this form and gives his own specific instructions to members of the household. Of course, he is not addressing a household but a church. He gives his instructions to whomever in the audience was a parent or a child or a slave.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this idea as you did in [2:20](../02/20.md) or non-figuratively.

By using this metaphor, Paul wants the Colossians to know that they are safe (**with Christ in God**) but also that their new life is not yet fully revealed (**hidden**).

Here, he speaks of the **old man** as if it were a piece of clothing that the Colossians could “take off.” This does not mean that their true selves are found underneath the **old man**, since the next verse has them putting on the **new man**.

The word translated **rule** is closely related to the word translated **deprive of your prize** Paul uses in [2:18](../02/18.md): both are used of a judge or an umpire making a decision, although in [2:18](../02/18.md), the judge or umpire decides against the Colossians. Here, the idea is that the **peace of Christ** acts as the judge or umpire in the **hearts** of the Colossians, which means that this **peace** helps them decide what to feel and do.

With this metaphor, he clarifies the situation in which they have been called to peace: in the **one body**, which is the church. Just as the parts of a body are at “peace” with each other (when the body is working properly), so also the Colossians are to be at peace with each other in the church.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “will receive a punishment that fits the crime” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Then, they would send the letter with a messenger, who would read the letter to the person or people it was addressed to. In this chapter, Paul mentions the messengers he is sending his letter with: Tychicus and Onesimus ([4:7–9](../04/07–09.md)). They also are able to communicate more about Paul’s situation than he says in the letter. Additionally, Paul mentions that he writes the final greeting “by my own hand” ([4:18](../04/18.md)). This is because the rest of the letter was written by a scribe, who wrote down what Paul dictated. Paul writes the last greeting as a personal touch and to prove that he was indeed the author. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Greetings&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this culture, it was common for those who sent letters to include greetings to and from others in their letter. In this way, many people could greet each other but only send one letter. Paul includes greetings to and from many people that he and the Colossians know in [4:10–15](../04/10–15.md). &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Important figures of speech in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Paul’s chains&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul refers to his imprisonment in this chapter by using the language of “chains” and “binding.” He says that he has “been bound” in [4:3](../04/03.md), and he mentions his “chains” in [4:18](../04/18.md). The language of binding and chains emphasizes how Paul is restricted in his movements and activities by being imprisoned. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### A “master in heaven”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [4:1](../04/01.md), Paul refers to a “master in heaven.” The word translated “master” and “masters” in this verse is the same word that is translated as “Lord” throughout Colossians. It is translated “master” in this verse to illustrate Paul’s point: those who are “masters” on earth also have a “master,” their Lord in heaven. If possible, make this wordplay clear in your translation. 
COL 4 1 b9nm  οἱ κύριοι 1 what is right and fair Here, Paul directly addresses the **Masters** in the audience.

COL 4 1 orih figs-metaphor τὸ δίκαιον καὶ τὴν ἰσότητα τοῖς δούλοις παρέχεσθε 1 what is right and fair Here, Paul speaks of how masters treat their slaves as if the master was “giving” the character of their relationship. By this, means that the thing given (**what is right and fair**) is what characterizes the master&amp;apos;s dealing with the slave. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this idea by using adverbs such as “rightly” and “fairly” with a verb such as “treat.” Alternate translation: “act rightly and fairly towards your slaves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL 4 1 ae3y figs-doublet τὸ δίκαιον καὶ τὴν ἰσότητα 1 what is right and fair The word translated **right** describes someone or something that properly follows laws, principles, and expectations.

If you do not have words that make these distinctions, you could express the idea with one word that indicates that something is fair, legal, and proper.

COL 4 1 t9wy figs-explicit Κύριον ἐν οὐρανῷ 1 you also have a master in heaven The word translated **master** here is usually translated **Lord** elsewhere, but it is here translated **master** because the same word is used for the “masters” at the beginning of the verse. Paul wishes the masters to treat their slaves justly because they also serve a Master, the Lord Jesus. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this idea by identifying that the **master** is the Lord Jesus.

COL 4 11 o5rh writing-pronouns οὗτοι 1 Jesus who is called Justus The word translated **These** refers back to the three men mentioned in this verse and the previous verse: Aristarchus, Mark, and Jesus. If it would be clearer in your language, you could restate their names or indicate in another way that these three are those named by **These**. Alternate translation: “These three are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

First, he identifies them as the **only** ones among his **fellow workers** who are Jewish (**from the circumcision**). In other words, Paul distinguishes them from all the other people who work with him, because these three men are the only ones who are circumcised Jews. Second, he describes them as ones **who have been a comfort** to him. Here, he is not distinguishing them from other fellow workers; instead, he just wishes to say that they have **been a comfort** to him. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could translate these two descriptions differently so that it is clear that the first distinguishes the three men while the second describes the three men. Alternate translation: “Out of all my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, these are the only ones being from the circumcision, and they have been a comfort to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
COL 4 11 ci74 figs-metonymy ὄντες ἐκ περιτομῆς 1 These are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God being from the circumcision Paul uses the label **from the circumcision** to identify the men as Jews who had received circumcision. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express this idea non-figuratively by using a term such as “Jewish.” Alternate translation: “who are Jewish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

COL 4 12 et2g  ἀσπάζεται 1 General Information: As was customary in this culture, Paul concludes the letter by extending greetings from people who are with him and who know the people to whom he is writing. Your language may have a particular way of sharing greetings in a letter. If so, you can use that form here. Alternate translation: “asks to be remembered to” or “says hello to”
COL 4 12 rq61 figs-idiom ὁ ἐξ ὑμῶν 1 He is from among you The phrase translated **from among you** means that Epaphras used to live with the Colossians and was part of the group to whom Paul is writing the letter. To express this idea, you could use a word or phrase that indicates in your language that a person belongs to a specific group of people. Alternate translation: “He is from your town” or “He used to live with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL 4 12 ek51 figs-hyperbole πάντοτε 1 a servant of Christ Jesus Here, **always** is an exaggeration that Paul uses to express how often Epaphras prays for the Colossians. If it would be clearer in your language, you can use a word that indicates frequency. Alternate translation: “consistently” or “frequently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
COL 4 12 p8ff figs-metaphor ἀγωνιζόμενος ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ἐν ταῖς προσευχαῖς 1 always striving on behalf of you in prayers The word translated **striving** is usually used for attempting to win a contest, whether that is athletic, military, or legal. While Epaphras is not actually participating in an athletic or military contest, Paul uses the metaphor to explain how earnestly Epaphras prays for the Colossians. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “praying zealously for you” or “spending much effort on his prayers for you” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
COL 4 12 sn23 grammar-connect-logic-goal ἵνα 1 you may stand complete and fully assured The word translated **so that** could introduce (1) the purpose or goal of Epaphras’s prayers. Alternate translation: “in order that” (2) the content of Epaphras’s prayers. Alternate translation: “asking that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
COL 4 12 nuh9 figs-metaphor σταθῆτε τέλειοι καὶ πεπληροφορημένοι ἐν παντὶ θελήματι τοῦ Θεοῦ 1 you may stand complete and fully assured Here, Paul speaks as if the Colossians can **stand … in all the will of God**. By this, he means that they should consistently do God’s will, just as if God’s will was something that they kept their feet on without moving. The words translated **complete and fully assured** explain the way in which they are supposed to **stand**, or continue to obey. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you may be complete and fully assured as you consistently do all the will of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL 4 12 t6o3 translate-unknown τέλειοι 1 you may stand complete and fully assured The word translated **complete** in this context means that a person is what he or she is supposed to be and is able to do what he or she is called to do. If this is not clear in your language, you could use a word that has this meaning, such as “perfect” or “excellent,” or translate **complete** with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “fit for what God has called you to be” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown)
COL 4 12 ojtu translate-unknown πεπληροφορημένοι 1 you may stand complete and fully assured The word translated **fully assured** describes people who are confident or sure of what they believe and do. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “convinced about what you know” or “without doubts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL 4 13 sg4h grammar-connect-words-phrases γὰρ 1 I testify for him, that he has much hard labor on behalf of you The word translated **For** introduces further support for Paul’s statements about Epaphras in the previous verse. In [4:12](../04/12.md), Paul says that Epaphras is “always striving” for them, and he supports that here by giving his own testimony about how hard Epaphras has worked for the Colossians and other believers who live near them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces support for a previous statement or refer back to what Paul is supporting. Alternate translation: “You can be sure that he does this because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
COL 4 13 k8vv figs-abstractnouns ἔχει πολὺν πόνον 1 I testify for him, that he has much hard labor on behalf of you If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **labor** by combining it with **has** to create one verb such as “labor.” Alternate translation: “he labors diligently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL 4 13 zzc8 figs-ellipsis τῶν ἐν Λαοδικίᾳ, καὶ τῶν ἐν Ἱεραπόλει 1 I testify for him, that he has much hard labor on behalf of you Here, Paul leaves out who **those** refers to, since in his language it was clear that **those** refers to people who live in the cities he mentions. If it would be clearer in your language, you could clarify that **those** refers to believers who live in these two towns. Alternate translation: “of believers who live in Laodicea, and of believers who live in Hierapolis” or “of believers who live in Laodicea and Hierapolis” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
COL 4 13 d0et figs-explicit Λαοδικίᾳ…Ἱεραπόλει 1 I testify for him, that he has much hard labor on behalf of you **Laodicea** and **Hierapolis** were towns near Colossae. In fact, they were all in the same valley. If it would be helpful to your readers to clarify that these are nearby towns, you could include this information.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could (1) include it with the phrase **and also Demas**. Alternate translation: “Luke the beloved physician greets you, and also Demas greets you” (2) move **and also Demas** before **greets you**. Alternate translation: “Luke the beloved physician and also Demas greet you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
COL 4 15 xi2b  ἀσπάσασθε 1 the brothers As was customary in this culture, Paul not only extends greetings from people who are with him and who know the people to whom he is writing (as he has done in [4:10–14](../04/10.md)). He also asks the Colossians to extend greetings for him to other people that both he and the Colossians know. Your language may have a particular way of sharing greetings in a letter. If so, you can use that form here. Alternate translation: “Remember me to” or “Say hello for me to”
COL 4 15 sc5g figs-gendernotations τοὺς…ἀδελφοὺς 1 the brothers The word translated **brothers** does not refer to only male people. Instead, it refers to both men and women who are part of the group of believers. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this idea with a word that does not refer to natural gender or you could use both male and female genders. Alternate translation: “the brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

COL 4 16 zzq4 figs-explicit ἀναγνωσθῇ…ἀναγνωσθῇ…ἀναγνῶτε 1 Nympha, and the church that is in her house In this culture, letters sent to a group were normally read out loud by one person to everyone else in the group. The words that are translated by **read** in this verse refer to this practice. If you have a way to refer to this practice, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “has been heard … it is heard … hear” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL 4 16 zvor figs-activepassive ἀναγνωσθῇ παρ’ ὑμῖν ἡ ἐπιστολή 1 Nympha, and the church that is in her house If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this in active form by supplying an indefinite subject such as “person” or by expressing the idea with a different verb such as “hear.” Alternate translation: “you have heard this letter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL 4 16 q4sz figs-explicit ποιήσατε ἵνα καὶ ἐν τῇ Λαοδικαίων ἐκκλησίᾳ ἀναγνωσθῇ, καὶ τὴν ἐκ Λαοδικίας ἵνα καὶ ὑμεῖς ἀναγνῶτε 1 Nympha, and the church that is in her house With these commands, Paul is asking the churches to exchange letters. He wants the Colossians to hear the letter he sent to Laodicea, and he wants the Laodiceans to hear the letter he sent to the Colossians. If you have a specific form to refer to sending and receiving letters, you could use it hear. Alternate translation: “send it off to Laodicea to be read in the church there, and request the letter I sent to them so that you can read it too” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL 4 16 q05z figs-idiom τὴν ἐκ Λαοδικίας 1 Nympha, and the church that is in her house The phrase **the one from Laodicea** refers to a letter that Paul has already sent or is about to send to the church in Laodicea. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use an expression that clarifies that this is a letter from Paul, not one written to Paul. Alternate translation: “the letter I addressed to Laodicea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL 4 17 z330  καὶ εἴπατε 1 say to Archippus, “Look to the ministry that you have received in the Lord, so that you may fulfill it.” In addition to asking the Colossians to greet others for him ([4:15](../04/15.md)), Paul also asks them to **say** something to Archippus. If you have a specific form in your language for instructions on relaying a message, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “And relay this message”

COL 4 17 dy11 figs-metaphor βλέπε τὴν διακονίαν 1 say to Archippus, “Look to the ministry that you have received in the Lord, so that you may fulfill it.” Here, Paul speaks as if Archippus’s **ministry** is something he can **look to**. By this, he means that he wants Archippus to focus on carrying out his ministry, just as if it was something he could stare at. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively.

COL 4 17 dau6 figs-extrainfo τὴν διακονίαν…παρέλαβες 1 say to Archippus, “Look to the ministry that you have received in the Lord, so that you may fulfill it.” Paul does not clarify or even hint at what **the ministry** is or from whom Archippus **received** it. If it is possible, leave these unclear in your translation. If you must include some extra information, you could use indefinite or vague words such as “thing” or “someone.” Alternate translation: “the task of serving in certain things … someone gave you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
COL 4 17 ufdy grammar-connect-logic-goal ἵνα 1 say to Archippus, “Look to the ministry that you have received in the Lord, so that you may fulfill it.” The word translated **so that** introduces a goal or purpose.

Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
COL 4 18 t5js  ὁ ἀσπασμὸς τῇ ἐμῇ χειρὶ 1 Remember my chains Paul concludes his letter by writing a final greeting to the Colossians.

COL 4 18 fqek figs-explicit τῇ ἐμῇ χειρὶ 1 Remember my chains In this culture, it was normal for a scribe to write down what the author of the letter was saying. Paul here indicates that he himself is writing these last words. The phrase **by my own hand** means that it was his own hand that took up the pen and wrote. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this with a comparable expression or include any extra information needed to make it clear. Alternate translation: “is in my handwriting” or “I write myself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL 4 18 sz0k figs-123person Παύλου 1 Remember my chains Here, Paul speaks of himself in the third person.

1TH front intro jp2y   0  # Introduction to 1 Thessalonians&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 1: General Introduction&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Outline of the Book of 1 Thessalonians&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Greeting (1:1)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Prayer of thanksgiving for the Thessalonian Christians (1:2-10)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Paul’s ministry in Thessalonica (2:1-16)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Paul’s concerns for their spiritual growth&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Like a mother (2:7)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Like a father (2:11)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Paul sends Timothy to the Thessalonians and Timothy reports back to Paul (3:1-13)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Practical instructions&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Live to please God (4:1-12)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Comfort regarding those who have died (4:12-18)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Christ’s return is a motive for godly living (5:1-11)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Closing blessings, thanks, and prayers (5:12-28)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote 1 Thessalonians?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote 1 Thessalonians. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote this letter while staying in the city of Corinth. Of all Paul’s letters that are in the Bible, many scholars think 1 Thessalonians was the first letter Paul wrote.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the Book of 1 Thessalonians about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote this letter to the believers in the city of Thessalonica. He wrote it after the Jews in the city forced him to leave. In this letter he said he considered his visit to them a success, even though he was forced to leave.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul responded to the news from Timothy about the Thessalonian believers. The believers there were being persecuted. He encouraged them to continue living in a way that pleased God. He also comforted them by explaining what happens to those who die before Christ returns.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “1 Thessalonians” or “First Thessalonians.” They may instead prefer to choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s First Letter to the Church in Thessalonica,” or “The First Letter to the Christians in Thessalonica.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the “second coming” of Jesus?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote much in this letter about Jesus’ eventual return to Earth. When Jesus returns, he will judge all mankind. He will also rule over creation, and there will be peace everywhere.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What happens to those who die before the return of Christ?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul made clear that those who die before Christ’s return will come back to life and be with Jesus. They will not remain dead forever. Paul wrote this to encourage the Thessalonians. For some of them worried that those who died would miss the great day when Jesus returns.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What did Paul mean by expressions like “in Christ” and “in the Lord.”?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul meant to express the idea of a very a close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Thessalonians?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;For the following verses, modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “May grace and peace be to you” (1:1). Some older versions read: “Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “Instead, we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children.” (2:7) Other modern versions and older versions read, “Instead, we were like babies among you, as when a mother comforts her own children.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God” (3:2). Some other versions read: “Timothy, our brother and servant of God.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

2TH front intro krd6   0  # Introduction to 2 Thessalonians&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 1: General Introduction&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Outline of the Book of 2 Thessalonians&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Greetings and thanksgiving (1:1-3)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Christians suffering from persecution&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * They are worthy of the kingdom of God and of his promise of relief from trials (1:4-7)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * God will judge those who persecute Christians (1:8-12)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Some believers’ misunderstanding about the second coming of Christ&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Christ’s return has not yet happened (2:1-2)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Instruction about the events that will precede the return of Christ (2:3-12)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Paul’s confidence that God will save the Thessalonian Christians&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * His call to “stand firm” (2:13-15)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * His prayer that God will comfort them (2:16-17)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Paul requests that the Thessalonian believers pray for him (3:1-5)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Paul give commands about idle believers (3:6-15)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Closing (3:16-17)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote 2 Thessalonians?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians. He was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote this letter while staying in the city of Corinth.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the Book of 2 Thessalonians about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote this letter to the believers in the city of Thessalonica. He encouraged the believers because they were being persecuted. He told them to continue living in a way that pleased God. And he wanted to teach them again about Christ’s return.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Thessalonians” or “Second Thessalonians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Second Letter to the Church in Thessalonica,” or “The Second Letter to the Christians in Thessalonica.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the “second coming” of Jesus?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote much in this letter about Jesus’ eventual return to Earth. When Jesus returns, he will judge all mankind. He will also rule over creation. And he will cause there to be peace everywhere. Paul also explained that a “man of lawlessness” will come before Christ’s return. This person will obey Satan and cause many people to oppose God. But Jesus will destroy this person when he returns.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 2 Thessalonians?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;For the following verses, modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “and the man of lawlessness is revealed” (2:3). The ULT, UST, and most modern versions read this way. Older versions have, “and the man of sin is revealed.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “For God chose you as the firstfruits for salvation” (2:13) The ULT, UST, and some other versions read this way. Other versions have, “For God chose you from the first for salvation.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
2TH 1 intro m987   0  # 2 Thessalonians 1 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Verses 1-2 formally introduce this letter. Letters in the ancient Near East commonly had introductions of this type.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Paradox&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. A paradox occurs in verses 4-5: “We talk about your patience and faith in all your persecutions. We talk about the afflictions that you endure. This is a sign of God’s righteous judgment.” People would not normally think that believing in God while being persecuted is a sign of God’s righteous judgment. But in verses 5-10, Paul explains how God will reward those who believe in him and how he will judge those who afflict them. ([2 Thessalonians 1:4-5](./04.md))

2TH 2 intro jq9r   0  # 2 Thessalonians 2 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “Being gathered together to be with him”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This passage refers to a time when Jesus calls to himself those who have believed in him.

1TI front intro wy83   0  # Introduction to 1 Timothy&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 1: General Introduction&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Outline of the Book of 1 Timothy&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this letter, Paul alternates between personal commands to Timothy that empower him to act as his representative and with his authority, and instructions for how followers of Jesus should live in community.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Greetings (1:1-2)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Paul commands Timothy to tell people not to teach false doctrines (1:3-20)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;3. Paul gives instructions about how to re-establish order and decency in the church (2:1-15)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;4. Paul gives instructions about how to ensure that elders and deacons are properly qualified (3:1-13)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;5. Paul commands Timothy regarding his own personal conduct (3:14-5:2)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;6. Paul gives instructions to ensure church support for worthy widows (5:3-16) and elders (5:17-20)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;7. Paul commands Timothy that he must be impartial (5:21-25)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;8. Paul gives instructions to ensure order in master-servant relationships (6:1-2a)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;9. Paul commands Timothy regarding how he should teach and conduct himself (6:2b-16)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;10. Paul gives instructions for how people who are rich should live (6:17-19)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;11. Paul commands Timothy to guard what has been entrusted to his care (6:20-21a)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;12. Closing blessing to the whole church (6:21b)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the Book of 1 Timothy?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;A man named Paul wrote 1 Timothy. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul may have written other letters to Timothy, but this is the earliest one that we still have. That is why it is known as 1 Timothy or First Timothy. Timothy was Paul’s disciple and close friend. Paul probably wrote this letter near the end of his life.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the Book of 1 Timothy about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul had left Timothy in the city of Ephesus to help the believers there. Paul wrote this letter to instruct Timothy about various matters. The topics he addressed included church worship, qualifications for church leaders, and warnings against false teachers. This letter shows how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches while Timothy himself trained other leaders.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its customary title, “1 Timothy” or “First Timothy.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “Paul’s First Letter to Timothy.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is discipleship?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Discipleship is the process of making people to be disciples of Christ. The goal of discipleship is to encourage other Christians to be more like Christ. This letter gives many instructions about how a leader should train a less mature Christian. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ”?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What are the major textual issues in the text of the book of 1 Timothy?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [6:5](../06/05.md), the oldest Greek manuscripts differ from later Greek manuscripts. Modern translations may also differ depending on the Greek manuscript that they translate from. The ULT text translates the Greek from the oldest manuscripts and puts the differences from later manuscripts in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider following the decision in that translation. If not, translators are advised to follow the oldest Greek manuscripts as reflected in the ULT text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1TI 1 intro a4v2   0  # 1 Timothy 1 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul formally introduces this letter in verses 1-2. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Spiritual children&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this chapter, Paul calls Timothy a “son” and his “child.” Paul discipled Timothy as a Christian and a church leader. Paul may also have led him to believe in Christ. Therefore, Paul called Timothy his “son in the faith.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Metaphor&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this chapter Paul speaks figuratively of people who are not fulfilling the purpose of their faith as if they had “missed the mark” that they were aiming at, as if they had “turned away” down a wrong path, and as if they had been “shipwrecked.” He speaks figuratively of following Jesus faithfully as “fighting the good fight.”
1TI 1 1 i3zz  Παῦλος 1 Paul In the culture of this time, letter writers would give their own names first. Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Immediately after introducing the writer, you might also want to indicate to whom the letter was written. Alternate translation: “I, Paul, am the one writing this letter to you, Timothy”
1TI 1 1 xl6d  κατ’ ἐπιταγὴν Θεοῦ 1 by the command of God Alternate translation: “by the authority of God”
1TI 1 1 wb8j  Θεοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν 1 God our Savior Alternate translation: “God, who saves us”
1TI 1 1 sw77 figs-metonymy Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τῆς ἐλπίδος ἡμῶν 1 the Lord Jesus Christ our hope Here, **our hope** refers figuratively to the person in whom we have hope. Alternate translations: “Christ Jesus, the one in whom we have confidence” or “Christ Jesus, whom we trust” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1TI 1 2 pyi6 figs-metaphor γνησίῳ τέκνῳ 1 a true son Paul speaks of his close relationship to Timothy as though they were father and son. This shows Paul’s sincere love and approval of Timothy. It is also likely that Paul personally led Timothy to trust in Christ. That would be another reason why Paul considered him to be like his own child, since Timothy entered his new life as a follower of Jesus because of Paul. Alternate translation: “who is truly like a son to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI 1 2 rd5v  χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη 1 Grace, mercy, peace In this culture, letter writers would offer a good wish for the recipient before introducing the main business of the letter. Alternate translation: “I hope you are experiencing God’s kindness, mercy, and peace”
1TI 1 2 p4lz guidelines-sonofgodprinciples Θεοῦ Πατρὸς 1 God the Father Here, **Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God, who is our Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1TI 1 2 zx37  Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν 1 Christ Jesus our Lord Alternate translation: “Christ Jesus, who is our Lord”
1TI 1 3 k4tm  καθὼς παρεκάλεσά σε 1 As I urged you Alternate translation: “as I told you”
1TI 1 3 k35a figs-yousingular σε 1 you In this letter, with one exception, the words **you**, **your**, and **yourself** refer to Timothy and so are singular. A note will discuss the one exception in [6:21](../06/21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
1TI 1 3 amp4  προσμεῖναι ἐν Ἐφέσῳ 1 remain in Ephesus “wait for me there in the city of Ephesus”
1TI 1 3 t112 translate-names Ἐφέσῳ 1 Ephesus This is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1TI 1 3 t113  τισὶν 1 certain ones Alternate translation: “certain people”
1TI 1 3 v4g2 figs-explicit ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖν 1 teach differently The implication is that these people were not teaching in a different way, but teaching different things than what Paul and Timothy taught. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “a different doctrine from what we teach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI 1 4 pw2h  μύθοις 1 fables These were fanciful stories of some kind, perhaps about the supposed exploits of various spiritual beings. But since we no longer know exactly what these stories were about, it would probably be best to use a general term for them. Alternate translation: “made-up stories”
1TI 1 4 qpv9 figs-hyperbole γενεαλογίαις ἀπεράντοις 1 endless genealogies Paul uses the term **endless** as an exaggeration to emphasize that these are very long. Alternate translation: “lists of names that seem as if they will never end” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1TI 1 4 ft33  γενεαλογίαις 1 genealogies Usually, this term refers to a record of a person’s ancestors. However, in this case it could also mean a record of the supposed ancestors of spiritual beings. Alternate translation: “lists of names”
1TI 1 4 qb9l  αἵτινες ἐκζητήσεις παρέχουσι 1 which promote arguments The people were debating about these stories and lists of names, but no one could know for certain whether they were true. Alternate translation: “these make people disagree angrily”
1TI 1 4 eu9f figs-abstractnouns οἰκονομίαν Θεοῦ 1 the stewardship of God If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **stewardship** with a concrete noun such as “plan” or “work.” Alternate translations: “helping us to understand God’s plan to save us” or “helping us to do God’s work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI 1 4 p2sr figs-abstractnouns τὴν ἐν πίστει 1 which is by faith If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** with a verb such as “trust” or “believe.” Alternate translations: “which we learn by believing in God” or “which we do by trusting in God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI 1 5 myi5  δὲ 1 Now Paul uses this word to introduce background information that will help Timothy understand the purpose of what he is commanding him. You can translate it with a word or phrase in your language that introduces background information.
1TI 1 5 iwnk grammar-connect-logic-goal τὸ δὲ τέλος τῆς παραγγελίας ἐστὶν 1 Now the goal of this command is Here Paul is expressing to Timothy the **goal** or the outcome that he desires from the commands that Paul gave him. Alternate translation: “I am commanding these things in order to get this result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1TI 1 5 l7un  παραγγελίας 1 command This refers to the instructions that Paul has given Timothy in [1:3](../01/03.md) and [1:4](../01/04.md).
1TI 1 5 i9rs figs-explicit ἐστὶν ἀγάπη 1 is love That God’s people would show **love** is the goal of the command. If it is necessary to include the object of “love,” you can say “each other” or “others.” This may also include love for God. Alternate translation: “is that God’s people would love others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI 1 5 t123 figs-metaphor ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας 1 from a pure heart Here the **heart** figuratively represents a person’s thoughts and inclinations. Alternate translation: “from a desire for only what is good” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI 1 5 mbe6 figs-metonymy ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας 1 from a pure heart Here, **pure** figuratively indicates that the person wants only good things and does not have mixed motives that also include some bad ones. Alternate translation: “from a desire for only what is good” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1TI 1 5 ar8t  συνειδήσεως ἀγαθῆς 1 a good conscience Your translation should make it clear that love is the one goal of the command and is followed by three things that lead to this love. This is the second thing, after “a pure heart.” Alternate translation: “and from a conscience that leads a person to choose right instead of wrong”
1TI 1 5 m53g  πίστεως ἀνυποκρίτου 1 a sincere faith This is the third thing that leads to love, which is the one goal of the command. It is not a third goal of the command. Alternate translations: “and from faith that is genuine” or “and from faith that is without hypocrisy”

1TI 2 9 sw21 translate-unknown μὴ ἐν πλέγμασιν 1 not in braided hair During this time, many Roman women braided their hair lavishly to try to make themselves attractive.

1TI 2 9 t210 figs-synecdoche μὴ ἐν πλέγμασιν 1 not in braids Paul mentions **braids** and gold as ways a woman could give undue attention to her hair. At the time, women would make elaborate braided hairstyles, often weaving in chains of gold. Alternate translations: “not with fancy hairstyles” or “not by means of elaborate hairstyles that attract attention” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1TI 2 9 rf5v translate-unknown μαργαρίταις 1 pearls These are beautiful and valuable mineral balls that people use as jewelry. They are formed inside the shell of a small animal that lives in the ocean. If your readers would not be familiar with pearls, you could express this idea in a more general way.

1TI 2 11 gb7a figs-idiom ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ 1 in quietness Paul may be saying that he wants the women to listen rather than to speak. Alternate translation: “by listening” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI 2 11 c7sh  ἐν πάσῃ ὑποταγῇ 1 in all submission Alternate translation: “and submit to the authority of the teacher”
1TI 2 12 t216  εἶναι ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ 1 to be in quietness As in [2:11](../02/11.md), Paul may be saying that he wants the women to listen rather than to speak. Alternate translation: “she should listen quietly”
1TI 2 13 iv31 figs-activepassive Ἀδὰμ…πρῶτος ἐπλάσθη 1 Adam was formed first If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “God created Adam first” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI 2 13 v7v6 figs-ellipsis εἶτα Εὕα 1 then Eve Here Paul leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “and then God created Eve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1TI 2 14 wq5k figs-activepassive Ἀδὰμ οὐκ ἠπατήθη 1 Adam was not deceived If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “Adam was not the one whom the serpent deceived” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

1TI 2 15 t222  σωθήσεται 1 she will be saved Here, **she** likely refers to Eve, mentioned in the preceding verse, and whom Paul describes as “the woman.” “They,” later in the sentence, refers to women in general. To show how Paul shifts the topic from Eve, a representative woman, to all women, the word **she** could be translated here as “women.”
1TI 2 15 u8iv  σωθήσεται…διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας 1 she will be saved through childbearing This could mean: (1) people thought that women would be condemned because of Eve’s sin and punished even more than with the pain of childbearing (see Genesis 3:16), or they may have thought that a woman who believed in Jesus was no longer under the punishment that God gave in Genesis 3:16. Since the Greek word translated **through** can also mean “with” or “while,” Paul may be saying here that women continue to have the punishment of pain in childbirth but will be saved from additional punishment as long as they have faith in Jesus. Alternate translation: “God will save women, although they do have to endure childbirth” (2) the women of the church in Ephesus were being led away from faith in Jesus by the false teachers (see 2 Timothy 3:6), so Paul is recommending that they focus on raising their families rather than listening to (or participating in) the “foolish talk” (1:6). Alternate translation: “God will save women as they attend to their families” (3) a reference to the birth of Jesus as a human child to be the Savior. Alternate translation: “God will save women through Jesus, who was born as a child”
1TI 2 15 i0ap figs-synecdoche διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας 1  If option number 2 from the previous note is correct, then Paul is figuratively referring to all of the aspects of motherhood by mentioning the beginning part of it: childbearing. Alternate translation: “as they attend to their families” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1TI 2 15 n818 figs-activepassive σωθήσεται 1 she will be saved If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “God will save women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI 2 15 gh3c  ἐὰν μείνωσιν 1 if they remain Here, **they** refers to women. Paul switches from the singular to the plural as he switches from talking about Eve as the representative of women to women in general. Alternate translation: “if women continue living”
1TI 2 15 sl57 figs-abstractnouns ἐν πίστει, καὶ ἀγάπῃ, καὶ ἁγιασμῷ 1 in faith and love and holiness If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **faith**, **love**, and **holiness** with verbs.

1TI 2 15 dcf3 figs-idiom μετὰ σωφροσύνης 1 with self-control This could mean: (1) with good judgment. (2) with modesty. (3) with clear thinking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Some titles include elder, pastor, and bishop. The word “overseer” reflects the Greek term in verses 1-2, which means literally an “over-seer.” The word “bishop” is derived directly from the letters of this Greek term. Paul writes about another kind of church leader, a “deacon,” in verses 8 and 12.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Character qualities&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This chapter lists several qualities that an overseer or deacon in the church must have. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI 3 1 t227  πιστὸς ὁ λόγος 1 This word is trustworthy As in [1:15](../01/15.md), in this context the term **word** has a meaning more like “statement” or “message.” Alternate translation: “this statement is dependable”
1TI 3 1 t228 figs-quotemarks πιστὸς ὁ λόγος 1 This word is trustworthy Paul uses this phrase to introduce a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by setting off the words that follow in the rest of the verse with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language may use to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

This also means that he does not commit adultery and may also mean that he has not divorced a previous wife. Alternate translations: “a man who has only one woman” or “a man who is faithful to his wife”
1TI 3 2 qnq9  δεῖ…εἶναι…νηφάλιον, σώφρονα, κόσμιον, φιλόξενον 1 must be … sober, self-controlled, orderly, hospitable Alternate translation: “He must … not do anything to excess, he must be reasonable and behave well, and he must be welcoming to strangers”

1TI 3 3 pc2g figs-metaphor ἀφιλάργυρον 1 not money-loving If the expression **loving** money would not convey the idea of something inappropriate in your language, it might be helpful to use a term that expresses the idea of “greed.” Alternate translation: “not greedy for money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI 3 4 a8gu  προϊστάμενον 1 managing Alternate translations: “he should lead” or “he should take care of”

1TI 3 5 n5lt figs-rquestion εἰ δέ τις τοῦ ἰδίου οἴκου προστῆναι οὐκ οἶδεν, πῶς ἐκκλησίας Θεοῦ ἐπιμελήσεται? 1 for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God? Paul is making a statement, not actually asking a question. He does not expect Timothy to explain how a man who could not manage his own household could take care of God’s church. Instead, Paul is using the question form to emphasize how important it is for an overseer to demonstrate faithfulness in his personal life before assuming a leadership role in the church. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “I say this because a man who is not able to manage his own household will certainly not be able to take care of the church of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1TI 3 5 c814 figs-metonymy ἐκκλησίας Θεοῦ 1 the church of God Here the term **church** refers to a local group of God’s people, not to a building. Alternate translations: “a group of God’s people” or “a local gathering of believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

This could refer to: (1) the believers in general. Alternate translation: “so that you all may know how to conduct yourselves as members of God’s family” (2) Timothy’s behavior in the church. Alternate translation: “so that you may know how to conduct yourself as a member of God’s family”
1TI 3 15 wzk3 figs-distinguish οἴκῳ Θεοῦ…ἥτις ἐστὶν ἐκκλησία Θεοῦ ζῶντος 1 the household of God, which is the church of the living God This phrase gives us further information about **the household of God**. It is not making a distinction between a household of God that is the church and one that is not the church. Alternate translation: “household of God, by which I mean the community of people who believe in the living God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

1TI 3 16 w473  μέγα ἐστὶν τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας μυστήριον 1 great is the mystery of godliness While in most of this letter Paul uses the term **godliness** to describe godly living, in this instance the term instead seems to describe the reverence for God that would lead a person to live a right life. Alternate translation: “the truth that God has revealed, that leads us to worship him, is great”
1TI 3 16 t271 figs-explicit μέγα ἐστὶν τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας μυστήριον 1 great is the mystery of godliness Since Paul follows this statement by quoting a hymn or poem about the life of Jesus, the implication is that he sees Jesus as having made it possible for people to worship God in the most genuine way. Alternate translation: “the truth that God has revealed about why we worship Jesus is great” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI 3 16 y8sp writing-poetry ὃς ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκί, ἐδικαιώθη ἐν Πνεύματι, ὤφθη ἀγγέλοις, ἐκηρύχθη ἐν ἔθνεσιν, ἐπιστεύθη ἐν κόσμῳ, ἀνελήμφθη ἐν δόξῃ 1 Who was revealed in flesh, was justified in the Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed among the nations, was believed in the world, was taken up in glory. This is most likely a song or poem that Paul is quoting. If your language has a way of indicating that this is poetry, such as through line-by-line formatting, you could use that here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])
1TI 3 16 m4xi figs-activepassive ὃς ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκί 1 Who was revealed in flesh If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. (Be sure not to suggest in your translation that Jesus only seemed or appeared to be human.) Alternate translations: “he revealed himself as a human being” or “he came to earth as a human being” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI 3 16 rqp6 figs-metonymy ἐν σαρκί 1 in flesh Paul uses the term **flesh** figuratively here to mean “in a human body.” He is describing the human body by reference to something associated with it, the flesh that envelops it.

1TI 3 16 mr3a figs-abstractnouns ἀνελήμφθη ἐν δόξῃ 1 was taken up in glory The abstract noun **glory** refers to the way Jesus received power from God the Father and is worthy of honor. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind this term with an adjective such as “powerful” and a verb such as “admire.” Alternate translation: “God the Father took him up to heaven, making him powerful and making everyone admire him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI 4 intro b39h   0  # 1 Timothy 4 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul speaks in [4:14](../04/14.md) of prophecy. A “prophecy” is a message that God communicates to people through someone to whom He has given a special gift of hearing and conveying these messages. The specific prophecy that Paul describes revealed how Timothy would become a gifted leader of the church. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Cultural practices&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In verse 14 Paul speaks of church leaders placing their hands on Timothy. That was one way of indicating publicly that a person was being placed in a leadership position in the church.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Variation in names&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this chapter Paul speaks of church leaders called “elders.” They seem to be the same kind of leaders that he calls “overseers” in chapter 3.
1TI 4 1 jzr9  δὲ 1 Now Paul uses this word to introduce background information that will help Timothy and the believers in Ephesus understand the next part of his letter. The false teachings that Timothy must oppose are something that the Spirit has already predicted. You can translate the term with the word or phrase in your language that is most similar in meaning and significance.
1TI 4 1 b739 figs-idiom ἐν ὑστέροις καιροῖς 1 in later times This expression refers to the time period when God’s purposes in history are approaching their culmination and so the evil opposition to them increases. Paul is probably referring to the time period between Jesus’ resurrection and his second coming. Alternate translation: “in these days as God’s purposes advance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

1TI 4 1 ae5w figs-doublet πνεύμασι πλάνοις καὶ διδασκαλίαις δαιμονίων 1 deceiving spirits and teachings of demons These two phrases mean similar things. Paul may be using them together for emphasis.

1TI 4 3 t289  κωλυόντων γαμεῖν 1 forbidding to marry If it would be helpful to your readers, you could begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “these people teach that it is wrong to marry”
1TI 4 3 wd2l figs-explicit κωλυόντων γαμεῖν 1 forbidding to marry The implication is that these false teachers will forbid believers to marry. Alternate translation: “these people will forbid believers to marry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI 4 3 t291 figs-ellipsis ἀπέχεσθαι βρωμάτων 1 to abstain from foods Here Paul leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. He does not mean that these false teachers will forbid believers to abstain from certain foods, but that the false teachers will require them to abstain from certain foods. In other words, the meaning of **forbidding** does not carry forward from the previous clause; rather, the meaning of “requiring” should be supplied.

1TI 4 5 gwcs grammar-connect-logic-result γὰρ 1  This word communicates that what follows is the reason for the last part of what Paul has just said. In other words, it is the reason why “nothing being received with thanksgiving is vile.” Use a natural way in your language to give a reason. Alternate translation: “because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TI 4 5 m5mb figs-activepassive ἁγιάζεται 1 it is sanctified If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translations: “it becomes holy” or “it is suitable to eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

1TI 4 7 elk7 figs-idiom γραώδεις μύθους 1 old-womanish myths The term **old-womanish** is an idiom that means “silly” or “foolish.” Paul tells Timothy in [5:2](../05/02.md) that he should respect older women as mothers, so Paul’s expression here should be recognized as idiomatic rather than disrespectful. Your language may have a similar expression. Alternate translation: “old wives’ tales” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI 4 7 sea5 figs-metaphor γύμναζε…σεαυτὸν πρὸς εὐσέβειαν 1 train yourself for godliness Paul tells Timothy figuratively to work to develop godly character as if he were an athlete improving his physical conditioning.

It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by setting off the words that follow in the rest of the verse with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language may use to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
1TI 4 8 i6rh  σωματικὴ γυμνασία 1 bodily training Alternate translation: “physical exercise”
1TI 4 8 t313  πρὸς ὀλίγον ἐστὶν ὠφέλιμος 1 is valuable for a little This could mean: (1) it has some small value. (2) it has value for a little while. (3) it does not have very much value.
1TI 4 8 df19  ἐπαγγελίαν ἔχουσα 1 having promise for Alternate translation: “will bring benefits”
1TI 4 9 t315  πιστὸς ὁ λόγος 1 That word is trustworthy As in [1:15](../01/15.md) and [3:1](../03/01.md), in this context, the term **word** means “statement” or “saying.” (Paul is referring to the entire saying that he quoted in the previous verse.) Alternate translation: “this statement is dependable”
1TI 4 9 hc1t  καὶ πάσης ἀποδοχῆς ἄξιος 1 and worthy of all acceptance See how you translated this in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translations: “and we should believe it without any doubt” or “and we should have full confidence in it”
1TI 4 10 l2yl grammar-connect-logic-result εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ 1 for unto this The term **this** refers to “godliness,” which Paul mentions in the previous two verses. Paul is giving a reason why Timothy should believe the saying about the value of godliness. He and his other fellow workers are striving very hard to become godly, so it must be valuable. Alternate translation: “after all, it is for godliness that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TI 4 10 c9db figs-doublet κοπιῶμεν καὶ ἀγωνιζόμεθα 1 we toil and struggle The terms **toil** and **struggle** mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them together to emphasize the intensity with which he and his fellow workers are serving God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “we work so hard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1TI 4 10 t320 figs-exclusive κοπιῶμεν καὶ ἀγωνιζόμεθα 1 we toil and struggle This could be the one place where **we** does not include the addressee. Paul has just told Timothy to make godliness his priority rather than physical exercise, and he may be offering himself and his other fellow workers as an example of that for Timothy to follow. So if your language makes that distinction, you may wish to use the exclusive form in this phrase. However, **we** in the next phrase would include Timothy, since Paul is encouraging Timothy to join him and his fellow workers in making godliness his priority as someone who, like them, has hoped in the living God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1TI 4 10 qmj6 figs-idiom Θεῷ ζῶντι 1 the living God See how you translated this in [3:15](../03/15.md). Alternate translations: “the God who is genuinely alive” or “the true God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

1TI 4 12 qi8l  μηδείς σου τῆς νεότητος καταφρονείτω 1 Let no one despise your youth The term **despise** here does not mean “hate,” but “think little of” or “scorn.” Alternate translation: “Do not let anyone disrespect you just because you are young”
1TI 4 12 t325  ἐν λόγῳ 1 in word In this context, the term **word** means “what you say.” Alternate translation: “in your speech”
1TI 4 13 t326 figs-explicit πρόσεχε τῇ ἀναγνώσει, τῇ παρακλήσει, τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ 1 to the reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly what Timothy is to read and to whom, and whom he is to exhort and teach.

1TI 4 14 xp1k figs-activepassive ὃ ἐδόθη σοι διὰ προφητείας 1 which was given to you through prophecy If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “which you received when leaders of the church prophesied about you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI 4 14 rr8f translate-symaction ἐπιθέσεως τῶν χειρῶν τοῦ πρεσβυτερίου 1 with the imposition of the hands of the elders Paul is speaking of a ceremony during which the church leaders put their hands on Timothy and prayed that God would enable him to do the work he had commanded him to do. Alternate translation: “when the elders all laid their hands on you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
1TI 4 15 sbcg figs-explicit ταῦτα 1 these things If it is helpful in your language, you may want to make explicit what **these things** are. Alternate translation: “these things that I am telling you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

1TI 4 15 merc figs-explicit σου ἡ προκοπὴ 1 your progress If it is helpful in your language, you may want to make explicit in what way Timothy is to make **progress**. Alternate translation: “your increasing ability to live the way that Jesus wants you to live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI 4 16 uq6c  ἔπεχε σεαυτῷ καὶ τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ 1 Pay attention to yourself and to the teaching Alternate translation: “Pay attention to how you live and to what you teach”
1TI 4 16 zxe7  ἐπίμενε αὐτοῖς 1 Continue in these things Alternate translation: “continue to do these things”
1TI 4 16 u7ez  καὶ σεαυτὸν σώσεις καὶ τοὺς ἀκούοντάς σου 1 you will save both yourself and your listeners This could mean: (1) Timothy will save himself and those who hear him from God’s judgment (2) Timothy will protect himself and those who hear him from the influence of false teachers. Perhaps Paul means both things since, if Timothy can persuade the people of the church in Ephesus not to listen to the false teachers, then he will also spare them from God’s judgment for the wrong things they would have done if they had listened to those teachers. Alternate translation: “you will keep both yourself and your listeners from believing and doing the wrong things”

1TI 5 1 wt5y figs-you  0 General Information: Paul was giving these commands to one person, Timothy. Languages that have different forms of “you” or different forms for commands would use the singular form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
1TI 5 1 l4w5  πρεσβυτέρῳ μὴ ἐπιπλήξῃς 1 Do not rebuke an older man Alternate translation: “do not reprimand an older man”

1TI 5 4 w38h  πρῶτον 1 first This could mean one of two things, or possibly both: (1) of all of their religious duties, taking care of their family is the most important one and the one that they should learn to do before anything else.

If **honor** is an idiom for “provide” here, as in the previous verse, then Paul may be using repetition for emphasis. Alternate translation: “let them provide the support that their widowed mother or grandmother needs and deserves” (2) have a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. Paul may actually be giving two reasons why people should support their widowed mothers or grandmothers.

Alternate translation: “also give these instructions to the believers, so that no one will be able to accuse them of doing anything wrong”

Alternate translation: “she was always faithful to her husband” (2) she was only married once.

1TI 5 10 t366 figs-synecdoche ἁγίων πόδας ἔνιψεν 1 has washed the feet of the saints Paul may be using one type of humble service figuratively to represent humble service in general.

Paul may be using repetition to emphasize that these women should not be looking into the private lives of people and telling about them to others who would be no better off after hearing this gossip. If you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these phrases into a single one. Alternate translation: “people who interfere openly in other people’s business” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]]) (A doublet can consist of more than two terms.)

1TI 5 17 wp9d figs-abstractnouns διπλῆς τιμῆς 1 of double honor Here, **double honor** could mean: (1) the congregation should honor the elders in two ways. Alternate translation: “of both respect and payment for their work” (2) they should honor them twice as much as others.

1TI 5 17 r8ew figs-nominaladj οἱ κοπιῶντες 1 the ones toiling Paul is using the participle **toiling**, which functions as an adjective, as a noun to refer to members of a class of people that it describes.

1TI 5 18 vw3a figs-metaphor βοῦν ἀλοῶντα οὐ φιμώσεις 1 You will not muzzle a threshing ox Paul is quoting this passage figuratively. He is using it to indicate that, just as God wanted oxen to be able to eat some of the grain that they were working to separate from its husks, so church leaders deserve to receive payment from the Christian community that they are serving.

1TI 5 21 dph6  ταῦτα φυλάξῃς 1 keep these things Alternate translation: “you follow these instructions”
1TI 5 21 t409  ταῦτα 1 these things Grammatically, this could refer either to the instructions Paul has just given Timothy about elders or to the instructions he is about to give Timothy regarding his own personal conduct. But since Paul tells Timothy to follow these instructions without favoring one person over another, it is most likely that this refers to the instructions about elders. Alternate translation: “these things that I have just told you”
1TI 5 21 t408 figs-doublet χωρὶς προκρίματος, μηδὲν ποιῶν κατὰ πρόσκλισιν 1 without partiality, doing nothing out of favoritism The terms **partiality** and **favoritism** mean similar things.

1TI 5 22 pyl8 figs-explicit μηδὲ κοινώνει ἁμαρτίαις ἀλλοτρίαις 1 nor share in the sins of others The implication in context may be that if Timothy appoints a person to leadership before they are ready or without ensuring that their character is exemplary, then Timothy will bear some responsibility for that person’s ultimate failure as a leader, or he will appear to have approved of the person’s sins, once they are uncovered. Alternate translation: “so that you do not become responsible for the moral and leadership failures of others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “are clear to everyone, even before the church leaders confront them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
1TI 5 24 i1c6 figs-personification τισὶν δὲ καὶ ἐπακολουθοῦσιν 1 but they also follow after some Paul speaks once again of sins as if they could move on their own. As in the previous clause, this could refer to: (1) judgment by God. Alternate translation: “but the sins of other people do not become evident until God judges them” (2) judgment by the church. Alternate translation: “but the sins of some people remain hidden for a long time” This latter alternative also allows the possibility that Paul is referring to judgment by God.

1TI 5 25 pd8v figs-explicit καὶ τὰ ἔργα τὰ καλὰ πρόδηλα 1 good works are also evident Implicitly, here Paul does not mean all good works, since in the rest of the sentence he speaks of some good works that are not evident.

2TI front intro s7fk   0  # Introduction to 2 Timothy&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 1: General Introduction&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Outline of the book of 2 Timothy&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Paul greets Timothy and encourages him to endure hardship as he serves God (1:1-2:13).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Paul gives general instructions to Timothy (2:14-26).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;3. Paul warns Timothy about future events and instructs him about how to carry out his service to God (3:1-4:8).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;4. Paul makes personal remarks (4:9-22).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the book of 2 Timothy?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote 2 Timothy. He was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This book is the second letter Paul wrote to Timothy. Timothy was his disciple and close friend. Paul wrote this letter while in prison in Rome. Paul would die soon after writing this letter.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the book of 2 Timothy about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul had left Timothy in the city of Ephesus to help the believers there. Paul wrote this letter to instruct Timothy about various matters. The topics he addressed include warnings about false teachers and advice about enduring difficult situations. This letter also shows how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Timothy” or “Second Timothy.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “Paul’s Second Letter to Timothy” or “The Second Letter to Timothy.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the soldier imagery in 2 Timothy?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;As Paul waited in prison, knowing he would die soon, he spoke of being a soldier of Jesus Christ. Soldiers have to obey to their leaders. In the same way, Christians have to obey Jesus. As “soldiers” of Christ, believers are to obey his commands, even if they die as a result.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What does it mean that God inspired Scripture?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;God is the true author of Scripture. He inspired the human authors who wrote the books. That means God in some way caused the people to write what they wrote. This is why the Bible is also referred to as God’s word. This implies several things about it. First, everything that the Bible teaches is free from error and can be trusted. Second, God will always preserve his Scripture for every generation of people. Third, God’s word should be translated into all the world’s languages.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Singular and plural “you”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. Here the word “you” is almost always singular and refers to Timothy. The exception to this is 4:22. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Inclusive and exclusive “we” and “us”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this book, “we” and “us” include the writer, Paul, the recipient, Timothy, and all believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What did Paul mean by the expressions “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union between Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What are the major textual issues in the text of the book of 2 Timothy?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;For the following verses, the oldest Greek manuscripts differ from later Greek manuscripts. Modern translations may also differ depending on the Greek manuscript that they translate from. The ULT text translates the Greek from the oldest manuscripts, and puts the differences from later manuscripts in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible already exists in the general region, translators should consider following the decision in that translation. If not, translators are advised to follow the oldest Greek manuscripts as reflected in the ULT text.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher” (1:11). Some later manuscripts read, “Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher to the Gentiles.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “Warn them before God” (2:14). Some later manuscripts read, “Warn them before the Lord.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
2TI 1 intro p5lf   0  # 2 Timothy 1 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul formally introduces this letter in verses 1-2. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Spiritual children&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul discipled Timothy as a Christian and a church leader. Paul may also have led him to believe in Christ. Therefore, Paul calls Timothy “beloved child.” So even though Paul was not Timothy’s father, Paul speaks of his relationship with Timothy as that of a father and son in a spiritual sense. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Persecution&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul was in prison when he wrote this letter. Paul encourages Timothy to be willing to suffer for the gospel.
2TI 1 1 p001 translate-names Παῦλος 1 Paul This is the name of a man, the author of the letter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2TI 1 1 ha4l  Παῦλος 1 Paul This letter follows the normal custom of the time by beginning with the name and identity of the author, then mentioning the recipient (in verse 2). Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. If so, you can use it in your translation. Alternate translation: “I, Paul, am writing this letter”
2TI 1 1 vl2g  διὰ θελήματος Θεοῦ 1 through the will of God Paul became an apostle because God wanted him to be an apostle. Alternate translation: “because of God’s will” or “because God wanted it to be so”
2TI 1 1 e1lg  κατ’ 1 according to This could mean: (1) God appointed Paul to tell others about the promise of life in Jesus. Alternate translation: “for the purpose of announcing” (2) Paul became an apostle because he himself received the promise of life in Jesus. Alternate translation: “as a result of receiving”
2TI 1 1 m9kv figs-metaphor ζωῆς τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ 1 of life that is in Christ Jesus Paul speaks of **life** as if it were an object inside of Jesus. This refers to the life people receive as a result of belonging to Christ Jesus. Alternate translation: “of the life that we receive as a result of belonging to Christ Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

2TI 1 18 f3ep figs-explicit ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ 1 in that day The expression **that day** refers to the day when God will judge all people; at that time they will receive mercy from the Lord, as Paul mentions, or wrath.

He uses analogies of soldiers, athletes, and farmers. Later in the chapter, he uses the analogy of different kinds of containers in a house.
2TI 2 1 bll5 figs-metaphor τέκνον μου 1 my child Here, **child** is a term of great love and approval. Timothy is not Paul’s biological child. It is also likely that Paul introduced Timothy to Christ, and so this is why Paul considered him like his own child. Alternate translation: “who are like my child” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “as you allow Christ Jesus to kindly empower you through your relationship to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI 2 2 ig9v figs-explicit διὰ πολλῶν μαρτύρων 1 along with many witnesses Paul is referring to teaching in a public setting with others present.

2TI 2 2 kv1m figs-metaphor ταῦτα παράθου πιστοῖς ἀνθρώποις 1 entrust these things to faithful men Paul speaks of his instructions to Timothy as if they were objects that Timothy could give to other people and trust them to use correctly.

2TI 2 2 p027 figs-gendernotations πιστοῖς ἀνθρώποις 1 to faithful men Here the term **men** has a generic sense that may include women. Alternate translation: “to faithful people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

2TI 2 4 a4x7 figs-metaphor οὐδεὶς στρατευόμενος ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις 1 No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in the affairs of life To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor of a soldier who has to decide between pleasing his leader or pleasing those outside the army. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this. Alternate translation: “Consider that no dedicated soldier allows the affairs of life to distract him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI 2 4 p7n5 figs-metaphor ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις 1 gets entangled in the affairs of life Paul speaks of being involved in other matters as if they were a net that trapped people and kept them from being able to move freely.

2TI 2 4 p029 figs-explicit τοῦ βίου 1 of life By **life**, Paul means, in the context of this metaphor, “civilian life.” The implication is that Timothy and all believers should not allow competing concerns to keep them from serving Christ.

2TI 2 5 d483 figs-metaphor ἐὰν…ἀθλῇ τις, οὐ στεφανοῦται, ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ 1 if anyone competes, he is not crowned if he has not competed lawfully To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor of an athlete who has to decide between competing lawfully or not lawfully. The athlete will only receive the crown given to the winner if he competes lawfully. By making this comparison with an athlete competing in games, Paul is implicitly telling Timothy that Christ will not reward him unless he serves him **lawfully**, that is, unless he obeys him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this directly. Alternate translation: “consider that the officials only crown an athlete as the winner if he competes according to the rules” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI 2 5 p031 figs-hypo ἐὰν…ἀθλῇ τις, οὐ στεφανοῦται, ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ 1 if anyone competes, he is not crowned if he has not competed lawfully Paul is also using a hypothetical situation to teach Timothy. Alternate translation: “suppose an athlete did not compete by the rules. Then he would not be crowned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
2TI 2 5 p032  ἐὰν…ἀθλῇ τις 1 if anyone competes Here, **competes** refers to competing in an athletic event. Alternate translation: “if an athlete competes in an event”
2TI 2 5 xbn6 figs-doublenegatives οὐ στεφανοῦται, ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ 1 he is not crowned if he has not competed lawfully If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this double negative as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “the officials will only crown him if he competes by the rules” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
2TI 2 5 p033 figs-activepassive οὐ στεφανοῦται 1 he is not crowned If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea. Alternate translation: “the officials will not crown him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2TI 2 5 p034 figs-explicit οὐ στεφανοῦται 1 he is not crowned Paul assumes that Timothy will know that in this culture crowning indicated the winner of a competition. Alternate translation: “the officials will not crown him as the winner” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI 2 5 lea8 translate-unknown οὐ στεφανοῦται 1 he is not crowned In Paul’s time, when athletes won competitions, they were crowned with wreaths made from the leaves of plants. You can express this idea in your translation by referring to the comparable custom in your own culture, or by using a general expression. Alternate translation: “the officials will not give him an award” or “the officials will not declare him to be the winner” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2TI 2 5 reg6 figs-explicit μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ 1 he has competed lawfully Paul is referring to the rules that governed a competition. The athletes had to obey the rules or they would be removed from the competition and not have an opportunity to win. If it would be clearer in your language, you can mention these rules. Alternate translation: “he does not compete according to the rules” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI 2 6 wz35 figs-metaphor τὸν κοπιῶντα γεωργὸν δεῖ πρῶτον τῶν καρπῶν μεταλαμβάνειν 1 The hardworking farmer ought to be first to receive of the crops To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor of a farmer who has to decide between working hard or not working hard. The farmer will receive a share of the harvest if he is working hard. By making this comparison, Paul is encouraging Timothy to work hard in his service to Christ so that God will reward him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this directly. Alternate translation: “Consider that a farmer who works hard should receive a share of the crops before anyone else” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI 2 6 p035 figs-explicit πρῶτον τῶν καρπῶν μεταλαμβάνειν 1 first to receive of the crops In this illustration, it seems that the hardworking farmer is working with other farmers who will all receive a part of the crop after the harvest. But since this farmer works harder than the others, he should receive before the others. It is implied that receiving first is best, possibly because the quality of the crop is better. Alternate translation: “receive the best share of the crops” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI 2 7 bdk9 figs-explicit νόει ὃ λέγω, δώσει γάρ σοι ὁ Κύριος σύνεσιν 1 Think about what I am saying, for the Lord will give you understanding Paul gave Timothy three metaphors in verses 3-6, but he did not completely explain their implications. He expected Timothy to figure out, with God’s help, the lesson of these metaphors for Christ’s servants. For that reason, if you want to include an explanation of the meaning of the metaphors, we recommend that you state the meaning in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. Alternate translation: “you will have to think carefully about what I have just told you to understand it completely, but you can depend on God to help you to do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI 2 7 p036 figs-metonymy ὃ λέγω 1 what I am saying Paul refers to what he has just written in his letter with the verb **saying** to express the idea of communicating. Alternate translation: “what I have just told you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2TI 2 7 a22q figs-explicit ἐν πᾶσιν 1 in everything Here, **in everything** refers to everything related to the three metaphors that Paul has written just before this. Alternate translation: “about everything that I have just said” or “about all that I said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI 2 8 mh1k figs-metaphor ἐκ σπέρματος Δαυείδ 1 from the seed of David The phrase **from the seed of** refers figuratively to Jesus being descended from King David. Alternate translation: “who is a descendant of David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI 2 8 p037 translate-names Δαυείδ 1 of David This is the name of a man, a great king of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2TI 2 8 wt31 figs-idiom ἐγηγερμένον ἐκ νεκρῶν 1 raised from the dead The expression **raised from the dead** is an idiom for causing someone who has died to become alive again. Alternate translation: “whom God caused to live again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

2TI 2 8 s4vh figs-possession κατὰ τὸ εὐαγγέλιόν μου 1 according to my gospel The term **my** conveys the idea that it is the gospel associated with Paul because he preaches it. Alternate translation: “according to the gospel message that I preach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2TI 2 9 t2ax figs-metonymy μέχρι δεσμῶν 1 unto chains Paul uses the expression **unto chains** figuratively to express how far his suffering has gone: from being beaten, to being arrested, to being in chains in prison. Alternate translation: “to the point of being imprisoned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2TI 2 9 p039 figs-simile ὡς κακοῦργος 1 like a criminal Paul compares his situation to the shameful one that a person would be in who had actually committed a crime. Alternate translation: “as if I were a criminal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
2TI 2 9 pc6t figs-metaphor ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐ δέδεται 1 the word of God is not bound Here, **bound** means being held in chains as a prisoner, referring to Paul’s condition. Paul contrasts himself, an actual prisoner, with God’s message, which can never be held prisoner. Alternate translation: “nothing is holding back the message from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI 2 9 p040 figs-activepassive ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐ δέδεται 1 the word of God is not bound If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this idea. Alternate translation: “nothing is holding back the message from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

2TI 2 10 p042 figs-hyperbole πάντα ὑπομένω 1 I endure all things Here the term **all** is a generalization that likely refers to the sufferings that Paul describes in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “I endure all of these sufferings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2TI 2 10 aa1x figs-nominaladj διὰ τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς 1 for the chosen The term **chosen** is an adjective that functions as a noun here and refers to a group of people. If your language would not use an adjective in that way, you can translate this term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “for the people whom God has chosen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
2TI 2 10 j2bk  καὶ αὐτοὶ σωτηρίας τύχωσιν τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ 1 they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus The phrase **obtain the salvation** could also be expressed with Christ Jesus, who grants salvation, as the subject. Alternate translation: “Christ Jesus may grant them salvation”
2TI 2 10 p043 figs-abstractnouns καὶ αὐτοὶ σωτηρίας τύχωσιν τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ 1 they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **salvation** with a verb. Alternate translation: “Christ Jesus may save them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI 2 10 el68 figs-abstractnouns μετὰ δόξης αἰωνίου 1 with eternal glory The abstract noun **glory** refers to the wonderful condition that people will experience when they are in the presence of God. It comes from God himself and he shares it with those who are saved by Jesus Christ, and this condition is **eternal**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **glory** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “and know how glorious it is to be with God forever” or “and experience God’s wonderful presence forever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI 2 11 nr7u  πιστὸς ὁ λόγος 1 This word is trustworthy In this context, the term **word** refers to the statement of doctrine that follows. See how you translated this phrase in [1 Timothy 1:15](../1ti/01/15.md) Alternate translation: “This statement is dependable”
2TI 2 11 p044  πιστὸς ὁ λόγος 1 This word is trustworthy You could represent the meaning of the adjective **trustworthy** with an active verb, if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “You can trust this statement”
2TI 2 11 p045 figs-quotemarks πιστὸς ὁ λόγος 1 This word is trustworthy Paul uses this phrase to introduce a direct quotation. The words that follow in the rest of this verse and in [2:12](../02/12.md) and [2:13](../02/13.md) are a poem or hymn that expresses the message that Paul says is trustworthy. It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by marking these words as a direct quotation or by setting them farther to the right, as the General Notes at the beginning of this chapter suggest. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
2TI 2 11 g6e4 writing-poetry εἰ γὰρ συναπεθάνομεν, καὶ συνζήσομεν 1 For if we died with him, we will also live with him This is the beginning of a poem or hymn that Paul is probably quoting. If your language has a way of indicating that this is poetry, such as by setting individual phrases on separate lines, you could use it here and in [2:12](../02/12.md) and [2:13](../02/13.md). If not, you could translate this material as regular prose rather than as poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])
2TI 2 11 in38 figs-metaphor εἰ…συναπεθάνομεν 1 if we died with him Paul is speaking figuratively since he and Timothy and other believers who should trust this statement have not actually died. This could refer to: (1) the way that believers accept Jesus’ death for their sins when they trust him for salvation. This means that they have figuratively “died” to their old life of sin. Alternate translation: “if we have ended our old way of life by accepting Jesus’ death for us” (2) the way that people who believe in Jesus may suffer for him, possibly to the point of dying for him. Alternate translation: “if we are prepared to die for Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI 2 11 p046  καὶ συνζήσομεν 1 we will also live with him Although Paul is referring to dying with Christ in a figurative sense, **live** is probably not figurative, but could refer to: (1) life after physical death. This seems most likely given Paul’s mention of “eternal glory” in the previous verse and “we will reign with him” in the next. Alternate translation: “then God will raise us from the dead to live with Jesus” (2) how believers will act in this life before physical death. Alternate translation: “we will not pursue our own desires, instead we will do what Jesus wants us to do”
2TI 2 12 p048  εἰ ἀρνησόμεθα 1 if we deny him Paul uses the term **deny** to refer to the action of believers saying that they do not know Jesus Christ during this present life. It is presented as the opposite of **endure**, so it refers to someone who gives in to persecution and denies being a follower of Jesus. Alternate translation: “if we say now that we do not know him”
2TI 2 12 p049  κἀκεῖνος ἀρνήσεται ἡμᾶς 1 he also will deny us In this second usage of the word **deny**, Paul is referring to the action of Jesus Christ on the day of final judgment. On that day, Jesus will either receive a faithful believer or reject those who are not true followers. Those who deny that they are followers of Jesus while on earth are not true followers. Alternate translation: “he will reject us on the day of judgment”
2TI 2 13 ke4w  εἰ ἀπιστοῦμεν 1 if we are unfaithful Paul uses the word **unfaithful** to express the condition of believers who do not continue to obey Jesus, but rather disobey him. Alternate translation: “if we disobey Jesus” or “if we do not do what Jesus wants us to do”
2TI 2 13 p050 figs-explicit ἐκεῖνος πιστὸς μένει 1 he remains faithful This could mean : (1) he remains faithful to them. (2) he remains true to himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI 2 13 ihd4  ἀρνήσασθαι…ἑαυτὸν οὐ δύναται 1 he is not able to deny himself Paul states that Jesus is not able to **deny himself**, meaning that Jesus is not able to go against his character and will remain true to what he said he would do. Paul may have one or both of the following ideas in mind. (1) Jesus’ character includes being the Savior who can forgive our unfaithfulness when we repent of it, as Peter experienced (John 21:15-19). This favors the interpretation of the previous phrase as “he remains faithful to us.” (2) Jesus’ character also includes being the holy God who judges people for their sin when they do not repent. This favors the interpretation of the previous phrase as “he remains true to himself.” Alternate translation: “he must always act according to his character”
2TI 2 14 u661  ὑπομίμνῃσκε 1 Remind them The word **them**, which is implicit in the Greek verb, probably refers to the people that Timothy has responsibility over. Alternate translation: “Remind the people there”
2TI 2 14 p051 figs-metaphor ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ 1 before God Paul uses the expression **before God**, which means “in front of God,” to mean “where God can see.” Seeing, in turn, figuratively means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “as God is watching” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI 2 14 r5lq figs-explicit ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ 1 before God The implication is that Paul is telling Timothy to tell the believers, when he gives them this command, that God will be watching what they do. Alternate translation: “with God as their witness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI 2 14 g6p7 figs-metaphor μὴ λογομαχεῖν 1 not to battle about words Paul uses the term **battle** figuratively to describe arguments. This could mean: (1) the believers are not to argue about unimportant things such as the words that someone uses to present the gospel message. That only distracts people from talking about important things, such as the gospel message itself. Alternate translation: “not to fight about small things like words” (2) the believers are not to argue about what words mean. Again, this causes disunity among the believers for no good reason. Alternate translation: “not to fight about the meanings of words” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI 2 14 rke6  ἐπ’ οὐδὲν χρήσιμον 1 it is useful for nothing Paul adds that battling about words has no benefit for those involved. Alternate translation: “it does not benefit anyone”
2TI 2 14 ywty figs-abstractnouns ἐπὶ καταστροφῇ τῶν ἀκουόντων 1 to the destruction of those who hear If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **destruction** with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “it destroys those who hear” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI 2 14 x7gx figs-metonymy ἐπὶ καταστροφῇ τῶν ἀκουόντων 1 to the destruction of those who hear Here, **destruction** refers not to physical harm, but to the spiritual harm that is done to believers who hear their teachers foolishly arguing about unimportant things. This teaches the believers that being seen as right about small things is more important than love and unity, and can cause them to have wrong ideas about the faith or to stop following Jesus altogether. Alternate translation: “and can make those who hear it want to stop following Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2TI 2 15 m3vy  σπούδασον σεαυτὸν, δόκιμον παραστῆσαι τῷ Θεῷ 1 Strive to present yourself approved to God Alternate translation: “Do your best to please God”
2TI 2 15 rj6y figs-metaphor ἐργάτην 1 a worker Paul says figuratively that Timothy will be a skilled workman if he correctly teaches God’s word. Alternate translation: “like a craftsman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI 2 15 xgz9 figs-metaphor ὀρθοτομοῦντα τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας 1 cutting the word of truth straight Paul refers figuratively to **the word of truth** as if it were a path that someone was cutting through difficult terrain. When such a path is **straight**, travelers can follow it directly to their destination. By contrast, the useless discussions that Paul describes in [2:14](../02/14.md) and [2:16](../02/16.md) would be needless detours in terms of this same metaphor. Alternate translation: “show people how to follow the Scriptures directly” or “teach the Scriptures correctly so that people can follow them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI 2 15 p052 figs-metonymy τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας 1 the word of truth Paul uses the term **word** figuratively to refer to something that is expressed in words. This could refer to: (1) the message that Timothy is to teach. Alternate translation: “the true message” (2) the Scriptures. Alternate translation: “the true things that God has said in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2TI 2 15 p053 figs-abstractnouns τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας 1 the word of truth If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **truth** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “the true message” or “the true things that God has said in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI 2 16 e27q figs-metaphor ἐπὶ πλεῖον…προκόψουσιν ἀσεβείας 1 they will advance into greater ungodliness Paul speaks of these discussions figuratively as if they could physically progress in a certain direction, and he speaks of godlessness as that direction. Paul is figuratively describing the effect that these discussions have on people. Alternate translation: “they cause people to become more and more ungodly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI 2 17 i73t figs-simile ὁ λόγος αὐτῶν ὡς γάγγραινα νομὴν ἕξει 1 their word will have a spreading like gangrene This is a simile. It means that something will spread from person to person and harm the faith of all those who hear it. The thing that will spread could refer to: (1) the habit of having useless and godless discussions. (2) the things that the people were saying in these empty discussions, or both. Alternate translation: “these empty discussions will spread quickly and cause destruction like an infectious disease” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

2TI 3 intro k2cr   0  # 2 Timothy 3 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Many scholars understand the **last days** to mean the entire time from when Jesus first came to when he will return, which includes Paul’s time. If so, then what Paul teaches in this chapter about being persecuted applies to all believers. But some scholars understand the **last days** to mean a time in the future just before Jesus returns. If that is the meaning, then Paul is prophesying in verses 1-9 and 13 about those days.

It is a way of commanding Timothy, not by Paul’s own authority, but by the authority that he then refers to, that of God and Jesus Christ. In other words, Paul is saying that God and Jesus Christ are commanding Timothy through Paul.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Crown&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Scripture uses the image of a crown to represent different things. In this chapter, Paul describes Christ as awarding a crown to believers as a metaphor for the reward that Christ will give them for having lived rightly on this earth.

TIT front intro m2jl   0  # Introduction to Titus&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 1: General Introduction&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Outline of the book of Titus&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Paul instructs Titus to appoint godly leaders. (1:1-16)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Paul instructs Titus to train people to live godly lives. (2:1-3:11)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;3. Paul ends by sharing some of his plans and sending greetings to various believers. (3:12-15)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the book of Titus?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote the book of Titus. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the book of Titus about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote this letter to Titus, his fellow worker, who was leading the churches on the island of Crete. Paul instructed him about selecting church leaders. Paul also described how the believers should behave towards each other. He also encouraged them all to live in a way that pleases God.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Titus.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to Titus” or “A Letter to Titus.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### In what roles can people serve within the church?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;There are some teachings in the book of Titus about whether a woman or divorced man can serve in positions of leadership within the church. Scholars disagree about the meaning of these teachings. Further study on these issues may be necessary before translating this book.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Singular and plural **you**&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this book, the word **I** refers to Paul. Also, the word **you** is almost always singular and refers to Titus. The exception to this is 3:15. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the meaning of **God our Savior**?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This is a common phrase in this letter. Paul meant to make the readers think about how God forgave them in Christ for sinning against him, and by forgiving them he saved them from being punished when he judges all people. A similar phrase in this letter is **our great God and Savior Jesus Christ**.
TIT 1 intro c7me   0  # Titus 1 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul formally introduces this letter in verses 1-4. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In verses 6-9, Paul lists several qualities that a man must have if he is to be an elder in the church. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns) Paul gives a similar list in 1 Timothy 3.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Elders&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The church has used different titles for church leaders. Some titles include overseer, elder, pastor, and bishop.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Should, may, must&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The ULT uses different words that indicate requirements or obligations. These verbs have different levels of force associated with them. The subtle differences may be difficult to translate. The UST translates these verbs in a more general way.

If it is clearer in your language, you can use an adjective phrase such as “what is true” or “the true message.” Paul wants people to know the true message about God and Christ so that they can live in a way that pleases God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Paul considers relationship to Christ through faith to be more important than biological relationship. Thus, because of their relative ages and shared faith in Christ, Paul considers Titus as his own son. It may also be that Paul led Titus to faith in Christ, and so Titus is like a son in this spiritual sense. Alternate translation: “you are like a son to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

TIT 1 9 abcj grammar-connect-logic-goal ἵνα 1 so that The connecting words **so that** introduce a goal or purpose relationship. The purpose for the elder to hold tightly to the trustworthy message is for him to be able to encourage others and rebuke those who oppose him. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that this is the purpose. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
TIT 1 9 pzi1  τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ 1 sound teaching The Greek word rendered at **sound** normally refers to physical health. Paul speaks of this teaching as if it would cause those who believe it to be spiritually healthy, rather than spiritually sick.

Alternate translation: “who refuse to obey and who say useless things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
TIT 1 10 ga6n  φρεναπάται 1 deceivers This phrase describes people who are actively trying to convince people to believe in something other than the true gospel that Paul preaches. Alternate translation: “people who persuade others to believe things that are not true”
TIT 1 10 abcd figs-hendiadys ματαιολόγοι, καὶ φρεναπάται 1 empty talkers and deceivers Both **empty talkers** and **deceivers** refer to the same people. They taught false, worthless things and wanted people to believe them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
TIT 1 10 pu74 figs-metonymy οἱ ἐκ τῆς περιτομῆς 1 those from the circumcision This refers to the Jewish Christians who taught that men must be circumcised in order to follow Christ. This teaching is false. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
TIT 1 11 f4iy  οὓς δεῖ ἐπιστομίζειν 1 It is necessary to stop them “You must prevent them from spreading their teachings” or “Someone must stop them from influencing others by their words”

TIT 1 12 y3zb figs-hyperbole Κρῆτες ἀεὶ ψεῦσται 1 Cretans are always liars “Cretans lie all the time.” This is an exaggeration that means that Cretans had a reputation to be liars. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
TIT 1 12 h3jb figs-metaphor κακὰ θηρία 1 evil beasts This metaphor compares the Cretans to dangerous wild animals. Alternate translation: “as dangerous as wild animals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

TIT 1 13 abck grammar-connect-logic-result δι’ ἣν αἰτίαν 1 For this reason The connecting words **For this reason** introduce a reason-result relationship. The reason is that what the Cretan prophet said about his people is true (they are liars, evil, and lazy), and the result is that Titus should rebuke them severely.

TIT 1 13 xyz2 figs-abstractnouns ἐν τῇ πίστει 1 in the faith Here the abstract noun **faith** represents the things that the people believe about God. Alternate translation: “in what they believe about God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
TIT 1 14 abcm grammar-connect-logic-contrast μὴ 1 not The connecting word **not** introduces a contrast to being “sound in the faith” in the previous verse. In order to be sound in the faith, the people must not pay any attention to the Jewish myths or the commands of people who do not follow the truth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
TIT 1 14 p28i  Ἰουδαϊκοῖς μύθοις 1 to Jewish myths This refers to the false teaching of the Jews.
TIT 1 14 m4a5 figs-metaphor ἀποστρεφομένων τὴν ἀλήθειαν 1 who turn away from the truth Paul speaks of the truth as if it were an object that one could turn away from or avoid. Alternate translation: “who reject the truth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Paul greets Philemon (1:1-3)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Paul makes requests of Philemon about Onesimus (1:4-21)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;3. Conclusion (1:22-25)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the Book of Philemon?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote Philemon. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Saul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul was in a prison when he wrote this letter.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the Book of Philemon about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul wrote this letter to a man named Philemon. Philemon was a believer in Jesus who lived in the city of Colossae. He owned a slave named Onesimus. Onesimus had run away from Philemon and possibly stole something from him as well. Onesimus went to Rome and visited Paul in prison there, where Paul brought Onesimus to Jesus.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul told Philemon that he was sending Onesimus back to him. Philemon had the right to execute Onesimus according to Roman law. But Paul said that Philemon should accept Onesimus back as a Christian brother. He even suggested that Philemon should allow Onesimus to come back to Paul and help him in prison.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Philemon.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to Philemon” or “The Letter Paul wrote to Philemon.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Does this letter approve the practice of slavery?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul sent Onesimus back to his former master. But that did not mean that Paul thought that slavery was an acceptable practice. Instead, Paul was more concerned with people being reconciled to each other and that they serve God in whatever situation they were in. It is important to note that in the culture of the time, people became slaves for various reasons and it was not considered a permanent state.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What does Paul mean by the expression “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. See the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Singular and plural “you”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. The word “you” is almost always singular and refers to Philemon. The two exceptions to this are 1:22 and 1:25. There “you” refers to Philemon and the believers that met at his house. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Three times Paul identifies himself as the author of this letter (in verses 1, 9, and 19). Evidently Timothy was with him and may have written down the words as Paul said them. All instances of “I,” “me,” and “my” refer to Paul. Philemon is the main person to whom this letter is written. All instances of “you” and “your” refer to him and are singular unless otherwise noted. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
PHM 1 1 ne8k figs-123person Παῦλος 1  Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. Use that here. Alternate translations: “From me, Paul” or “I, Paul” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person)
PHM 1 1 cgs4  δέσμιος Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ 1 a prisoner of Christ Jesus Paul was in prison because people in authority did not want him to preach about Jesus. They put him there in order to stop him and to punish him. This does not mean that Jesus had put Paul in prison. Alternate translation: “a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus”
PHM 1 1 sv3p  ὁ ἀδελφὸς 1 our brother Paul is using the term **brother** figuratively to mean someone who shares the same faith. Alternate translation: “our fellow Christian” or “our companion in the faith” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
PHM 1 1 y9zu figs-exclusive ὁ ἀδελφὸς 1  Here, the word **our** is not in the original, but was necessary for English, which requires that a relationship word indicate who the person is related to. In this case, **our** would be inclusive, relating Timothy to Paul and the readers as a brother in Christ. If your language requires this, you can do the same. If not, you can follow the original wording, which says, “the brother.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

PHM 1 2 kyzo  Ἀπφίᾳ…Ἀρχίππῳ…τῇ…ἐκκλησίᾳ 1  The letter is predominantly addressed to Philemon. It could be misleading to suggest Paul is writing to **Apphia**, **Archippus**, and **the church** in Philemon’s house, on the same level as he is writing to Philemon.
PHM 1 2 sq44 translate-names Ἀρχίππῳ 1 Archippus This is the name of a man in the church with Philemon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
PHM 1 2 mnn5 figs-metaphor τῷ συνστρατιώτῃ ἡμῶν 1 our fellow soldier Paul speaks here of Archippus as if he and Archippus were both soldiers in an army. He means that Archippus works hard, as Paul himself works hard, to spread the gospel. Alternate translation: “our fellow spiritual warrior” or “who also fights the spiritual battle with us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHM 1 2 uof9  καὶ τῇ κατ’ οἶκόν σου ἐκκλησίᾳ 1  Apphia and Archippus were probably also members of the church that met at Philemon’s house. If mentioning them separately would imply that they were not part of the church, you could include a word like “other.” Alternate translation: “to the other members of the church in your house”

Therefore, the meaning is: “hearing of the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus and of your love for all the saints.”Paul said exactly that in Colossians 1:4 without the poetic structure. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])

PHM 1 6 t54l figs-abstractnouns ἡ κοινωνία τῆς πίστεώς σου 1 the fellowship of your faith The word translated **fellowship** means a sharing or a partnership in something. Paul probably intends both meanings, but if you must choose, it could mean: (1) that Philemon shares the same faith in Christ as Paul and others. Alternate translation: “the faith that you share with us” (2) that Philemon is a partner with Paul and others in working for Christ. Alternate translation: “your working together with us as believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHM 1 6 hcwp figs-abstractnouns ἡ κοινωνία τῆς πίστεώς σου, ἐνεργὴς γένηται ἐν ἐπιγνώσει παντὸς ἀγαθοῦ τοῦ ἐν ἡμῖν εἰς Χριστόν. 1  If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** with a verb such as “trust” or “believe,” and the abstract noun **knowledge** with a verb such as “know” or “learn.” Alternate translation: “as you trust in the Messiah along with us, you may become increasingly better at serving the Messiah, as you learn about all of the good things that he has given us to use for him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

PHM 1 14 ngg8 figs-abstractnouns ἵνα μὴ ὡς κατὰ ἀνάγκην τὸ ἀγαθόν σου ᾖ 1 but according to good will If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **compulsion** with a verb.

PHM 1 17 e1j2 grammar-connect-condition-fact εἰ…με ἔχεις κοινωνόν 1 if you have me as a partner Paul is writing in a way that makes it seem as though it is possible that Philemon does not consider that Paul is his partner, but he knows that Philemon does consider Paul to be his partner. This is a way of getting Philemon to agree on one thing (that Paul is a partner) so that he will agree to the other thing (to receive Onesimus). If your language does not state something as uncertain if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since you have me as a partner” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
PHM 1 17 e0es grammar-connect-logic-result οὖν 1  **Therefore** means that what came before this word is the reason for what comes after it. It may be that Paul intends for everything that came before to be the reason, because this word also indicates that Paul is now coming to the main point of the letter. Use a natural method in your language to indicate this transition. Alternate translation: “Because of all of these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
PHM 1 17 d56r figs-ellipsis προσλαβοῦ αὐτὸν ὡς ἐμέ. 1  Paul is leaving out some of the words here that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

Alternate translation: “receive him just as you would receive me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
PHM 1 18 nq4j grammar-connect-condition-fact εἰ δέ τι ἠδίκησέν σε ἢ ὀφείλει 1  Onesimus certainly did wrong to Philemon by running away, and he probably also stole some of Philemon’s property. But Paul is stating these things as uncertain in order to be polite. If your language does not use a conditional statement in this way, then use a more natural way to state this. Alternate translation: “But whatever he has taken or whatever wrong he has done to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
PHM 1 18 w4ys  εἰ δέ τι ἠδίκησέν σε ἢ ὀφείλει 1  These two phrases mean similar things, although **wronged you** is more general than **owes you**. If it would be more natural in your language, you can put the more general phrase second. Alternate translation: “But if he owes you anything or has wronged you in any way”
PHM 1 18 j3ou  τοῦτο ἐμοὶ ἐλλόγα. 1  Alternate translation: “I will take responsibility for repaying you” or “say that I am the one who owes you”
PHM 1 19 wb53  ἐγὼ Παῦλος ἔγραψα τῇ ἐμῇ χειρί 1 I, Paul, write this with my own hand Paul wrote this part with his **own hand** so that Philemon would know that these words were really from Paul, and that Paul really would pay him. He used the past tense here because the action of writing would be in the past when Philemon read the letter. Use the tense that is most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “I, Paul, write this myself.”
PHM 1 19 gn6c figs-irony ἵνα μὴ λέγω σοι 1 in order not to say to you Paul says that he will not say something to Philemon while saying it. This is a polite way of emphasizing the truth of what Paul is telling him. If your language would not use irony like this, then use a more natural expression. Alternate translation: “I do not need to remind you” or “You already know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
PHM 1 19 st7e figs-explicit καὶ σεαυτόν μοι προσοφείλεις 1 you also owe me your own self Paul was implying that whatever Onesimus or Paul owed to Philemon was canceled by the larger amount that Philemon owed to Paul, which was Philemon’s own life. The reason that Philemon owed Paul his life can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “you even owe me your own life” or “you owe me much more because I saved your life” or “you owe me your own life because I told you about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHM 1 20 mw03 figs-metaphor ἀδελφέ 1  Here, **brother** is a metaphor for a fellow believer. Alternate translation: “spiritual brother” or “brother in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHM 1 20 cqd0 figs-metaphor ἐν Κυρίῳ 1  See how you translated **in the Lord** in verse 16. This metaphor refers to being a believer in Jesus and means the same as **in Christ**.

PHM 1 20 kmpp figs-metonymy ἀνάπαυσόν μου τὰ σπλάγχνα 1 refresh my inward parts Here, **inward parts** is a metonym for a person’s feelings, thoughts, or inner being. Alternate translation: “encourage me” or “comfort me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
PHM 1 21 azje figs-abstractnouns πεποιθὼς τῇ ὑπακοῇ σου 1 refresh my inward parts If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **confidence** and **obedience** with verbs. Alternate translation: “Because I am confident that you will obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHM 1 21 lxxi  ἔγραψά σοι 1 refresh my inward parts Paul used the past tense here because the action of writing would be in the past when Philemon read the letter. Use the tense that is most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “I write to you”
PHM 1 22 xpn6 checking/headings  0 Connecting Statement: Here Paul closes his letter and gives final instruction to Philemon and a blessing on Philemon and on the believers that met for church in Philemon’s house. If you are using section headings, you could put one here before verse 22. Suggested heading: “Final Instruction and Blessing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/checking/headings]])
PHM 1 22 bx62 grammar-connect-time-simultaneous ἅμα 1 at the same time The word translated **at the same time** indicates that Paul wants Philemon to do something else for him while he does the first thing. You can make this clear in your translation with an appropriate connecting word or phrase.

HEB front intro xy4n   0  # Introduction to Hebrews&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 1: General Introduction&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Outline of the Book of Hebrews&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Jesus is superior to God’s prophets and angels (1:1-4:13)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Jesus is superior to the priests who serve in the temple in Jerusalem (4:14-7:28)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Jesus’ ministry is superior to the old covenant that God made with his people (8:1-10:39)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. What faith is like (11:1-40)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Encouragement to be faithful to God (12:1-29)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Concluding encouragements and greetings (13:1-25)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the Book of Hebrews?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;No one knows who wrote Hebrews. Scholars have suggested several different people who could possibly be the author. Possible authors are Paul, Luke, and Barnabas. The date of writing is also not known. Most scholars think it was written before A.D. 70. Jerusalem was destroyed in A.D. 70, but the writer of this letter spoke about Jerusalem as if it had not yet been destroyed.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the Book of Hebrews about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In the Book of Hebrews, the author shows that Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. The author did this in order to encourage the Jewish Christians and to explain that Jesus is better than anything that the old covenant had to offer. Jesus is the perfect High Priest. Jesus was also the perfect sacrifice. Animal sacrifices became useless because Jesus’ sacrifice was once and for all time. Therefore, Jesus is the one and only way for people to be accepted by God.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Hebrews.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The Letter to the Hebrews” or “A Letter to the Jewish Christians.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Can readers understand this book without knowing about the sacrifices and the work of the priests required in the Old Testament?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;It would be very difficult for readers to understand this book without understanding these matters. Translators might consider explaining some of these Old Testament concepts in notes or in an introduction to this book.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How is the idea of blood used in the Book of Hebrews?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Beginning in [Hebrews 9:7](../heb/09/07.md), the idea of blood is often used as metonymy to represent the death of any animal that was sacrificed according to God’s covenant with Israel. The author also used blood to represent the death of Jesus Christ. Jesus became the perfect sacrifice so that God would forgive people for sinning against him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Beginning in [Hebrews 9:19](../heb/09/19.md), the author used the idea of sprinkling as a symbolic action. Old Testament priests sprinkled the blood of the animals sacrificed. This was a symbol of the benefits of the animal’s death being applied to the people or to an object. This showed that the people or the object was acceptable to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How are the ideas of “holy” and “sanctify” represented in Hebrews in the ULT?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God views Christians as sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless, faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses “holy,” “holy God,” “holy ones,” or “holy people.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* Sometimes the meaning indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses “believer” or “believers.” (See: 6:10; 13:24)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* Sometimes the meaning implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “sanctify,” “set apart,” “dedicated to,” or “reserved for.” (See: 2:11: 9:13; 10:10, 14, 29; 13:12)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Hebrews?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;For the following verses, modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “you crowned him with glory and honor” (2:7). Some older versions read, “you crowned him with glory and honor and you have put him over the works of your hands.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “those who did not unite in faith with those who obeyed” (4:2). Some older versions read, “those who heard it without joining faith to it.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come” (9:11). Some modern versions and older versions read, “Christ came as a high priest of the good things that are to come.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “on those who were prisoners” (10:34). Some older versions read, “of me in my chains.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “They were stoned. They were sawn in two. They were killed with the sword” (11:37). Some older versions read, “They were stoned. They were sawn in two. They were tempted. They were killed with the sword.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned” (12:20). Some older versions read, “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned or shot with an arrow.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
HEB 1 intro aaf9   0  # Hebrews 1 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This chapter describes how Jesus is more important to us than the angels are.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 1:5, 7-13, which are words from the Old Testament.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “Our ancestors”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The writer wrote this letter to Christians who had grown up as Jews. This is why the letter is called “Hebrews.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Important figures of speech in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Rhetorical questions&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The author uses rhetorical questions as a way of proving Jesus is better than the angels. Both he and the readers know the answers to the questions, and the writer knows that as the readers think about the answers to the questions, they will realize that God’s Son is more important than any of the angels.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Poetry&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Jewish teachers, like the Old Testament prophets, would put their most important teachings in the form of poetry so that the hearers would be able to learn and remember them.

HEB 9 intro p8vy   0  # Hebrews 9 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This chapter describes how Jesus is better than the temple and all its laws and rules. This chapter will be difficult to understand if the first five books of the Old Testament have not yet been translated.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Will&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;A will is a legal document that describes what will happen to a person’s property after he dies.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Blood&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In the Old Testament, God had commanded the Israelites to offer sacrifices so that he would forgive their sins. Before they could offer these sacrifices, they had to kill animals and then offer not only the animal’s body but also its blood. Shedding blood is a metaphor for killing an animal or person. Jesus offered his life, his blood, as a sacrifice when he allowed men to kill him. The writer of the Book of Hebrews is saying in this chapter that this sacrifice is better than the sacrifices of the Old Testament. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Return of Christ&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Jesus will return to finish the work that he began when he died so that God would forgive his people’s sins. He will finish saving those people who are waiting for him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### First covenant&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This refers to the covenant that God made with Moses. However, before he made this covenant, God had made a covenant with Abraham. But this was the first covenant that God had made with the people of Israel. You may decide to translate “the first covenant” as “the earlier covenant.”

HEB 10 intro nev1   0  # Hebrews 10 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this chapter, the writer finishes describing how Jesus’ sacrifice was better than the sacrifices offered in the Temple. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 10:5-7, 15-17, 37-38, which are words from the Old Testament.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### God’s judgment and reward&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Holy living is important for Christians. God will hold people accountable for how they lived their Christian life. Even though there will not be eternal condemnation for Christians, ungodly actions do and will have consequences. In addition, faithful living will be rewarded. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/reward]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The sacrifices themselves had no redeeming power. They were effective because they were a display of faith, which was credited to the person offering the sacrifice. It was ultimately the sacrifice of Jesus which then makes these sacrifices “take away sins.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/redeem]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “The covenant that I will make”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;It is unclear whether this prophecy was being fulfilled as the author was writing or whether it was to occur later. The translator should try to avoid making a claim about the time this covenant begins. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])

The ULT does this with the poetry in 13:6, which are words from the Old Testament.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Hospitality&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;God wants his people to invite other people to come to their homes to eat food and even to sleep. His people should do this even if they do not know well the people they are inviting. In the Old Testament, Abraham and his nephew Lot both showed hospitality to people they did not know. Abraham served a costly meal to them, and then Lot invited them to sleep in his house. They learned later that those people were actually angels.

Greetings (1:1)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Gaining endurance through trials (1:2-4)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;3. Trusting God for wisdom (1:5-8)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;4. What poor and rich people should boast about (1:9-11)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;5. Enduring temptation (1:12-15)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;6. Hearing and doing what God’s Word says (1:16-27)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;7. A warning against favoring rich people (2:1-13)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;8. Faith and works (2:14-26)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;9. The need for self-control in speech (3:1-12)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;10. Worldly wisdom and heavenly wisdom contrasted (3:13-18)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;11. Worldly desires and the sin and conflict they cause (4:1-12)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;12. A warning against boasting about tomorrow (4:13-17)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;13. Rebuke of rich people (5:1-6)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;14. Waiting patiently for the Lord’s return (5:7-11)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;15. Oaths forbidden (5:12)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;16. Prayer, forgiveness, and healing (5:13-18)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;17. Restoration of a sinner (5:19-20)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the book of James?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;There is wide agreement among biblical scholars that the author of this book was James the half-brother of Jesus, who was a leader in the early church in the city of Jerusalem. He was respected for his wisdom and authority. For example, he had the last word at the Jerusalem Council, an important meeting of the early church, that is described in [Acts 15:13-21](../act/15/13.md). In [Galatians 2:9](../gal/02/09.md), the apostle Paul calls him a “pillar” of the church, meaning one of its most important leaders. However, even though James was an influential church leader and the half-brother of Jesus, in this letter he introduces himself humbly as “a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This is not the same man as the apostle James, who was the brother of the apostle John. That James was killed for his faith a few years after Jesus himself was killed and rose from the dead. This letter was written many years after that.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What kind of writing is the book of James?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The book of James has an opening that is typical of the letters of its time, but it does not have a main body that develops sequentially and logically the way a letter would have. Instead, the book presents a collection of short sayings and reflections on various subjects. (In that way it is similar to the book of Proverbs.) As the outline at the beginning of this introduction shows, the book is made up of many short sections that move around from topic to topic.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;James uses many of the devices that speakers used in his time, such as anticipating and answering a question that someone might ask. He also uses many vivid examples drawn from both nature and everyday life. For this reason, many interpreters believe that for the content of this book, James drew on sermons he had preached and on wise advice he had given. He wanted to share all of that wisdom with Christians living in different parts of the Roman Empire to help them face difficult times. It is also possible that James wrote this letter because he was nearing the end of his life and he wanted his wisdom to be preserved and shared after his death.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### To whom was the book of James written?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;James wrote this letter to believers in Jesus who had a Jewish background. This is clear from many of the things that he says in the letter. For example, he addresses his readers figuratively as “the twelve tribes” in [1:1](../01/01.md). He speaks of their meeting place as a “synagogue” in [2:2](../02/02.md). He assumes in [2:19](../02/19.md) that they are familiar with the essential Jewish affirmation that “God is one,” and in [2:21](../02/21.md) he calls Abraham “our father.” He calls God by the Hebrew title the Lord of Sabaoth in [5:4](../05/04.md). He assumes that his readers will be familiar from the Hebrew Scriptures with the stories of people such as Job ([5:11](../05/11.md)) and Elijah ([5:17](../05/17.md)). These notes will call attention to the places where James engages his readers in light of their Jewish background.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the book of James about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this letter, James writes to believers living all over the Roman Empire who are suffering. He tells them that God is working through their sufferings to help them become more mature Christians. James also writes much in this letter about how believers should live in this world and treat one another. He urges them to treat other people fairly, not to quarrel and fight, and to be compassionate and generous.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “James.” Alternatively, they may choose a different title such as “A Letter from James” or “The Letter James Wrote.” But note that “James” is actually the English form of the author’s name. In the letter itself, he calls himself “Jacob,” which is the original Hebrew form of his name. So you may want to refer to him in the title of the book by the same name that you will use in your translation for the character of Jacob in the book of Genesis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Did James disagree with Paul about how a person is justified before God?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Paul taught in Romans that Christians are justified by faith and not by works. James seems to teach that Christians are justified by works. This could be confusing. However, a better understanding of what Paul and James each taught shows that they actually agree with one another. Both of them taught that a person needs faith in order to be justified. They both also taught that true faith would lead a person to do good works. Paul and James taught about these things in different ways because they had different audiences who needed to know different things about being justified. James wrote primarily to Jewish Christians, while Paul wrote to communities in which there were many Gentile Christians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the translator signal transitions between topics in the book of James?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;James moves briskly from one topic to another. Often he does not end his discussion of one topic with a summary and then begin the discussion of the next topic with an introduction. It might be helpful to your readers if you set topics apart by putting blank lines between them. However, your readers would have the same experience of the letter that its original audience did if you allowed the transitions between topics to remain abrupt. Just as happens in the book of Proverbs, James seems to have wanted each new thought to strike his audience with fresh force. So you may also choose not to put any blank lines between topics in your translation.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;James often makes the link between topics through key words, for example, “rejoice” in 1:1 and “joy” in 1:2; “lacking” in 1:4 and “lacks” in 1:5; and so forth. If you can find ways to translate these key words similarly in both of their occurrences, this should help your readers appreciate the link and the transition.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Changes from the present tense to the past tense&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In several places where James offers an illustration of a point he has just made, he narrates that illustration in the past tense as if he were telling the story of something that had happened. If this would be confusing for your readers, you could translate these illustrations in the present tense. Notes will identify each of these places and make that suggestion.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Textual issues in the book of James&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;See the General Notes to chapter 2 for a discussion of one important textual issue in this book.
JAS 1 intro pz2q   0  # James 1 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Greetings (1:1)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Gaining endurance through trials (1:2-4)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;3. Trusting God for wisdom (1:5-8)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;4. What poor and rich people should boast about (1:9-11)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;5. Enduring temptation (1:12-15)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;6. Hearing and doing what God’s Word says (1:16-27)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;James begins this letter in [1:1](../01/01.md) by giving his name, identifying the people to whom he is writing, and offering a greeting. That was the way people typically began letters at this time. However, as Part 1 of the Introduction to James explains, the letter does not then develop the way other letters did. Instead, it is a collection of short sayings and reflections.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Testing and temptation&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;James uses a word in this chapter that can mean both “trial,” as in [1:2](../01/02.md) and [1:12](../01/12.md), and “temptation,” as in [1:13-14](../01/13.md). In both cases the word speaks of the situation of a person who needs to choose between doing something good and doing something evil. The difference between the two senses is important. When ULT translates the word as “trial,” God is testing the person and wants him to do what is good. When ULT translates the word as “temptation,” Satan is tempting the person and wants him to do what is evil.
JAS 1 1 pkt2 figs-123person Ἰάκωβος 1 James In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, and they would refer to themselves in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the first person. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, you could also use that if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I, James, am writing this letter” or “From James” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
JAS 1 1 j000 translate-names Ἰάκωβος 1 James This is the name of a man, the half-brother of Jesus. See the information about him in Part 1 of the Introduction to James. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
JAS 1 1 j001 figs-metonymy ταῖς δώδεκα φυλαῖς 1 to the twelve tribes James is speaking figuratively of the nation of Israel by association with the fact that it was made up of twelve tribes. Alternate translation: “to the nation of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 1 1 l4i7 figs-metaphor ταῖς δώδεκα φυλαῖς 1 to the twelve tribes James is speaking figuratively of Jesus’ followers as if they were the nation of Israel, since the community of the people of God had expanded from that nation to include people of every nation who followed Jesus. Alternate translation: “to followers of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 1 j002 figs-123person ταῖς δώδεκα φυλαῖς 1 to the twelve tribes In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would then say to whom they were writing, naming those people in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the second person. Alternate translation: “to you followers of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
JAS 1 1 vza9 figs-abstractnouns ἐν τῇ διασπορᾷ 1 in the dispersion At this time, the term **dispersion** referred to those Jews who were living away from their homeland of Israel and who were scattered into various parts of the Roman Empire. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **dispersion** with a verb such as “scattered.” Alternate translation: “scattered throughout the world” or, if you are using the second person, “who are scattered throughout the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 1 j003 figs-metaphor ἐν τῇ διασπορᾷ 1 in the dispersion While the term **dispersion** referred literally to Jews, James is using it figuratively to describe followers of Jesus. Alternate translation: “scattered throughout the world” or, if you are using the second person, “who are scattered throughout the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 1 huk9 figs-idiom χαίρειν. 1 Rejoice! The word **Rejoice** was used at this time as a greeting. In your translation, you can use the greeting that is typical of your language and culture. Alternate translation: “Greetings!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 1 2 knw6 figs-abstractnouns πᾶσαν χαρὰν ἡγήσασθε 1 Consider it all joy If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **joy** with an adjective such as “happy.” Alternate translation: “You should be happy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 2 j004 figs-hyperbole πᾶσαν χαρὰν ἡγήσασθε 1 Consider it all joy James says **all** as an overstatement for emphasis. He does not mean that believers should be happy about all the bad things that happen to them when they encounter **trials**. Rather, he means that the **trials** provide a general occasion for them to rejoice because of the valuable things God that is developing in their lives. He describes these things in the next verse. Alternate translation: “You should be very happy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
JAS 1 2 j005 figs-metaphor ἀδελφοί μου 1 my brothers James is using the term **brothers** figuratively to refer to fellow believers in Jesus. Alternate translation, as in UST: “my fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 2 j006 figs-gendernotations ἀδελφοί μου 1 my brothers James is using the term **brothers** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Be sure that this is clear in your translation so that your readers do not get the impression that James is addressing only men. If you use a non-figurative word such as “believers” to translate the metaphor **brothers**, you may need to use both the masculine and the feminine forms of that word in your language. If you retain the metaphor, you could say “my brothers and sisters.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
JAS 1 2 j007 figs-metaphor περιπέσητε 1 you fall into James is speaking figuratively of **trials** as if they were a hole or pit that believers could **fall into**. Alternate translation: “you encounter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 2 j008 figs-you περιπέσητε 1 you fall into The pronoun **you** is plural here, since James is writing to believers in Jesus as a group. Generally throughout the letter, the pronouns “you” and “your” are plural for this same reason. These notes will identify the few places where they are singular instead. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
JAS 1 3 j009  γινώσκοντες ὅτι 1 knowing that It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here, as UST does. Alternate translation: “I want you to know that” or “You should realize that”
JAS 1 3 xud2 figs-abstractnouns τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως κατεργάζεται ὑπομονήν 1 the testing of your faith produces endurance If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **testing**, **faith**, and **endurance** with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “when you rely on God to help you through a difficult situation, this teaches you not to give up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 4 j2p4 figs-personification ἡ δὲ ὑπομονὴ ἔργον τέλειον ἐχέτω 1 But let endurance have a perfect work The expression **let endurance have a perfect work** means “let endurance complete its work.” James is speaking figuratively as if the quality of **endurance** were actively developing the character of believers. Alternate translation: “But make sure that you completely develop the ability not to give up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JAS 1 4 unh4 figs-doublet τέλειοι καὶ ὁλόκληροι 1 perfect and whole The words **perfect** and **whole** mean similar things. James is using them together for emphasis. In this context, the word **perfect** does not mean without any flaws. Rather, it refers to something that has reached its goal. The word **whole** describes something that is not missing any of its parts or pieces. Together, the words describe mature Christian character. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this pair of words with a single expression. Alternate translation: “completely mature” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
JAS 1 4 l7ef  ἐν μηδενὶ λειπόμενοι 1 lacking in nothing You could state this positively in your translation. Alternate translation: “having all that you need” or “being all that you need to be”
JAS 1 5 du7z figs-abstractnouns λείπεται σοφίας 1 lacks wisdom If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **wisdom** with an adjective such as “wise.” Alternate translation: “is not sure what would be the wise thing to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 5 q2df  αἰτείτω παρὰ…Θεοῦ 1 let him ask from God Alternate translation: “let him ask God”
JAS 1 5 xu31 figs-activepassive δοθήσεται αὐτῷ 1 it will be given to him If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will give it to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JAS 1 6 j010 figs-abstractnouns ἐν πίστει 1 in faith If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** with a verb such as “trust.” Alternate translation: “confidently trusting God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 6 y2mk figs-doublenegatives μηδὲν διακρινόμενος 1 doubting nothing If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative verb **doubting** and the negative object **nothing**. Alternate translation: “with complete certainty that God will answer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
JAS 1 6 p12l figs-simile ἔοικεν κλύδωνι θαλάσσης, ἀνεμιζομένῳ καὶ ῥιπιζομένῳ 1 has become like a wave of the sea, wind-blown and tossed The point of this comparison is that anyone who doubts will be like the waves in the ocean, which keep moving in different directions. In your translation, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. (However, you could also reproduce the simile, as suggested in the next note.) Alternate translation: “will keep changing his mind about what to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
JAS 1 6 j011 translate-unknown κλύδωνι θαλάσσης, ἀνεμιζομένῳ καὶ ῥιπιζομένῳ 1 a wave of the sea, wind-blown and tossed If you would like to use a simile in your translation but your readers would not be familiar with a **wave of the sea**, you could use another illustration that would be familiar to them. Alternate translation: “the desert sand swirling in the wind” or “stalks of tall grass swaying back and forth in the wind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
JAS 1 6 j012 figs-activepassive κλύδωνι θαλάσσης, ἀνεμιζομένῳ καὶ ῥιπιζομένῳ 1 a wave of the sea, wind-blown and tossed If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “an ocean wave that the wind is blowing and tossing around” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JAS 1 7 j013 figs-gendernotations μὴ γὰρ οἰέσθω ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος 1 For let that man not think James is using the term **man** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “Such a person should not think” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
JAS 1 8 b5t6 figs-metaphor ἀνὴρ δίψυχος 1 a double-minded man James speaks figuratively of this person as if he had two minds, with one mind deciding to do one thing and the other mind deciding to do something else. Alternate translation: “a man who cannot make up his mind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 8 j014 figs-gendernotations ἀνὴρ δίψυχος 1 a double-minded man James is using the term **man** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “a person who cannot make up his mind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
JAS 1 8 k89p figs-metaphor ἀκατάστατος ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ 1 unsettled in all his ways James is speaking figuratively as if life presented paths for people to follow, and he is speaking figuratively of this person as if he could not settle on which path to take. Alternate translation: “who cannot decide whether to do one thing or another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 9 j015  καυχάσθω δὲ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὁ ταπεινὸς 1 Now let the lowly brother boast James is using the word **boast** in a positive sense. He does not mean it in the sinful sense of bragging or vaunting oneself over others. Alternate translation: “Now let the lowly brother take satisfaction”
JAS 1 9 gc9b figs-metaphor ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὁ ταπεινὸς 1 the lowly brother Since James contrasts this person with “the rich” in the next verse, he is using the word **lowly** as a spatial metaphor to mean “poor.” Alternate translation: “a believer who is poor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 9 j016 figs-metaphor ἀδελφὸς 1 brother James is using the term **brother** figuratively to refer to a fellow believer in Jesus. See how you translated the term in [1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: “believer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 9 j017 figs-abstractnouns τῷ ὕψει αὐτοῦ 1 his exaltation If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **exaltation** with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the high place he occupies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 9 yxs5 figs-metaphor τῷ ὕψει αὐτοῦ 1 his exaltation James is using a spatial metaphor to describe poor believers as if they were in a high place. He wants to convey that God has shown special concern for them. Alternate translation: “the special concern that God has shown for him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 10 uzk7 figs-ellipsis ὁ δὲ πλούσιος, ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει αὐτοῦ 1 but the rich in his lowliness James is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from the previous verse. Alternate translation: “but let the rich boast in his lowliness” or “but let the rich take satisfaction in his lowliness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JAS 1 10 w4ta figs-nominaladj ὁ…πλούσιος 1 the rich James is using the adjective **rich** as a noun in order to indicate a type of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. It is clear in context that James is speaking of a rich “brother” or “believer,” in parallel with the “lowly brother” he describes in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “a believer who is rich” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
JAS 1 10 j018 figs-abstractnouns τῇ ταπεινώσει αὐτοῦ 1 his lowliness If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **lowliness** with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the low place he occupies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 10 j019 figs-metaphor τῇ ταπεινώσει αὐτοῦ 1 his lowliness James is using a spatial metaphor to describe rich believers as if they were in a low place in order to indicate that God has taught them humility. Alternate translation: “the humility that God has taught them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 10 ulk4 figs-explicit τῇ ταπεινώσει αὐτοῦ 1 his lowliness If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly, as UST does, that God has taught rich believers humility by showing them that their wealth does not make them better than other people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 1 10 j020 figs-euphemism παρελεύσεται 1 he will pass away James is using a mild expression to refer to death. Alternate translation: “he will die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
JAS 1 10 nug7 figs-simile ὡς ἄνθος χόρτου 1 like a flower of the grass The point of this comparison is that just as wild flowers bloom only for a short time, rich people will live on earth for the same relatively short time as anyone else, so their riches do not give them any advantage. You could explain the meaning of this figurative expression in your translation. (However, you could also reproduce the simile, as suggested in the next note.) Alternate translation: “after living for only a relatively short time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
JAS 1 10 j021 translate-unknown ὡς ἄνθος χόρτου παρελεύσεται 1 like a flower of the grass If you would like to use a simile in your translation but your readers would not be familiar with a **flower of the grass** (that is, a wildflower), you could use a different illustration. You could use something familiar to them that lasts only for a short time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
JAS 1 11 j022  ἀνέτειλεν γὰρ ὁ ἥλιος σὺν τῷ καύσωνι, καὶ ἐξήρανεν τὸν χόρτον, καὶ τὸ ἄνθος αὐτοῦ ἐξέπεσεν, καὶ ἡ εὐπρέπεια τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἀπώλετο 1 For the sun rose with heat and dried up the grass, and its flower fell off and the beauty of its face perished Here James is giving an illustration in the past tense as if he were telling the story of something that had happened. (See the discussion of this in Part 3 of the Introduction to James.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this with the present tense. Alternate translation: “For the sun rises with heat and dries up the grass, and its flower falls off and the beauty of its face perishes”
JAS 1 11 j023 grammar-connect-logic-result γὰρ 1 For James is giving the reason for the result he implicitly described in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “This is because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JAS 1 11 j024  σὺν τῷ καύσωνι 1 with heat Here, **heat** could mean one of two things. (1) It could refer to intense, withering heat. Alternate translation: “and radiated withering heat” or, if you are using the present tense, “and radiates withering heat” (2) It could refer to a hot wind that occurs in full sunlight. Alternate translation: “and caused a hot wind” or, if you are using the present tense, “and causes a hot wind”
JAS 1 11 j025 figs-abstractnouns ἡ εὐπρέπεια τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἀπώλετο 1 the beauty of its face perished If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **beauty** with an adjective such as “beautiful.” Alternate translation: “it no longer had a beautiful appearance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 11 j026 figs-metaphor ἡ εὐπρέπεια τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἀπώλετο 1 the beauty of its face perished James speaks figuratively of the wild **flower** as if it had a **face**. Alternate translation: “it no longer had a beautiful appearance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 11 gv7v figs-metaphor ἡ εὐπρέπεια τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἀπώλετο 1 the beauty of its face perished James speaks figuratively of the flower’s **beauty** as if it **perished** or died. Alternate translation: “it no longer had a beautiful appearance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 11 j027 figs-simile οὕτως καὶ 1 Thus also James uses the words **Thus also** to introduce a simile or comparison between a rich person and a fading flower. Alternate translation: “In the same way” or “Likewise” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
JAS 1 11 j028 figs-nominaladj ὁ πλούσιος 1 the rich James is using the adjective **rich** as a noun in order to indicate a type of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “a person who is rich” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
JAS 1 11 ng26 figs-metaphor μαρανθήσεται 1 will wither James speaks of the **rich** person as if he were a flower that would **wither**. James means figuratively that this person will “die,” as UST indicates. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 11 sdi2 figs-metaphor ἐν ταῖς πορείαις αὐτοῦ 1 in his journeys James speaks figuratively of a **rich** person’s activities as if they were a journey that he was taking. This metaphor implies that he is giving no thought to his coming death and that it will take him by surprise. Alternate translation: “in the midst of his activities” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 12 m13d figs-idiom μακάριος ἀνὴρ ὃς ὑπομένει πειρασμόν 1 Blessed is the man who endures trial **Blessed is** indicates that God is giving favor to someone or that his situation is positive or good. Alternate translation: “The person who endures trial receives God’s favor” or “The person who endures trial is in a positive situation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 1 12 j029 figs-gendernotations ἀνὴρ 1 the man James is using the term **man** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “the person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
JAS 1 12 vr4a  ὑπομένει πειρασμόν 1 endures trial Here, **trial** could mean one of two things. See the discussion of the word in the General Notes to this chapter. James may actually want his readers to hear both senses in this case, as this verse is making a transition from a discussion of testing into a discussion of temptation. (1) The word **trial** could mean the same thing as in [1:2-3](../01/02.md), where it describes the “testing” of “faith.” The reading of UST expresses this interpretation. (2) The word could refer to being tempted, that is, being led by one’s desires to do something wrong, which James discusses in the following verses. Alternate translation: “resists temptation”
JAS 1 12 vta6  δόκιμος γενόμενος 1 becoming approved How you translate this will depend on how you translate **trial** earlier in the sentence. (In your translation, you could also focus on the way that God approves of this person, as UST does.) Alternate translation: “once he has demonstrated his faithfulness” of “once he has demonstrated his obedience”
JAS 1 12 j030 figs-possession λήμψεται τὸν στέφανον τῆς ζωῆς 1 he will receive the crown of life James is using the possessive form not to refer to a **crown** that belongs to **life** but to describe **life** as if it were a **crown**. Alternate translation: “he will receive the crown that is life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JAS 1 12 k3hh figs-metaphor λήμψεται τὸν στέφανον τῆς ζωῆς 1 he will receive the crown of life James is using the image of a **crown** figuratively to indicate that God will honor this person. Alternate translation: “God will honor him by giving him life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 12 j031 figs-metaphor λήμψεται τὸν στέφανον τῆς ζωῆς 1 he will receive the crown of life James is likely not speaking of physical **life** but of spiritual **life**, that is, of living forever in the presence of God after physical death. Alternate translation: “God will honor that person by giving him everlasting life in his presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 12 hx28 writing-pronouns ὃν ἐπηγγείλατο τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν 1 which he promised to the ones who love him In this last clause in the verse, the words **he** and **him** refer to God, not to the person who **endures trial**. Alternate translation: “which God promised to those who love him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JAS 1 13 lh7z figs-activepassive ἀπὸ Θεοῦ πειράζομαι 1 I am tempted by God If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God is tempting me” or “God is leading me to do something wrong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JAS 1 13 p5cp  ὁ…Θεὸς ἀπείραστός ἐστιν κακῶν 1 God is untempted by evil Even though the word that ULT translates as **untempted** is an adjective, not a passive verbal form, it may be clearer in your language if you translate it with an active verbal form. Alternate translation: “evil does not tempt God” or “God’s desires never lead him to do something wrong”
JAS 1 13 zb13  πειράζει δὲ αὐτὸς οὐδένα 1 and he himself tempts no one Alternate translation: “and God himself never leads anyone to do anything wrong”
JAS 1 14 j032 grammar-connect-logic-contrast δὲ 1 But James is using the word **But** to indicate a contrast between the wrong idea that God might tempt someone and the truth that each person **is tempted by his own desire**. This is actually a strong contrast, and you may wish to use a strong expression for it. Alternate translation: “No, on the contrary,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
JAS 1 14 j033 figs-activepassive ἕκαστος…πειράζεται ὑπὸ τῆς ἰδίας ἐπιθυμίας, ἐξελκόμενος καὶ δελεαζόμενος 1 each is tempted by his own desire, dragged away and enticed If it would be clearer in your language, you could say each of these things with active verbal forms. Alternate translation: “each person’s own desire tempts him by enticing him and then dragging him away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JAS 1 14 nj9m figs-personification ἕκαστος…πειράζεται ὑπὸ τῆς ἰδίας ἐπιθυμίας, ἐξελκόμενος καὶ δελεαζόμενος 1 each is tempted by his own desire, dragged away and enticed James is speaking figuratively of **desire** as if it were a living thing that could actively tempt people, entice them, and drag them away captive. Alternate translation: “each person wants to do wrong when he desires something that he should not desire and, because he is attracted to that thing, he commits sin and then cannot stop sinning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JAS 1 14 nle5 figs-events ἐξελκόμενος καὶ δελεαζόμενος 1 dragged away and enticed Since the word translated as **enticed** often means to use bait to trap prey, James may be stressing the result (the captured prey being **dragged away**) by speaking of it before the method that was used to achieve it (baiting a trap). It may be clearer in your language to indicate that the method came before the result. Alternate translation: “enticed and dragged away” or “dragged away after being enticed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
JAS 1 14 z4bd figs-metaphor ἐξελκόμενος καὶ δελεαζόμενος 1 dragged away and enticed James is speaking figuratively of temptation as if the person who gave in to it were captured in a baited trap. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate this metaphor as a simile. It may also be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “It is as if the wrong thing he desired were bait in a trap that caught him so that a hunter could then drag him away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 15 j034 grammar-connect-time-sequential εἶτα ἡ ἐπιθυμία συλλαβοῦσα τίκτει ἁμαρτίαν 1 Then desire, having conceived, bears sin James uses the word **Then** to indicate that what he describes in this verse happens after something that he described in the previous verse. However, he does not mean that this happens after a person is “dragged away and enticed,” as he said at the end of that verse. Rather, he means that it happens after a person begins to entertain the temptation of a wrong “desire,” as he said at the beginning of that verse. It may be clearer in your language to use the word “when” to indicate this. Alternate translation: “When desire has conceived, it bears sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
JAS 1 15 s4cd figs-personification εἶτα ἡ ἐπιθυμία συλλαβοῦσα τίκτει ἁμαρτίαν 1 Then desire, having conceived, bears sin James continues to speak figuratively of **desire** as if it were a living thing, in this case as if it were a woman who became pregnant and gave birth. Alternate translation: “If a person entertains wrong desires, he will become more and more inclined to sin until he finally does commit sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JAS 1 15 j035 figs-personification ἡ δὲ ἁμαρτία ἀποτελεσθεῖσα, ἀποκύει θάνατον 1 and sin, having grown up, gives birth to death James also speaks figuratively of **sin** as if it were a living thing, a baby girl who grew up to be a woman who also became pregnant and gave birth. Alternate translation: “and if he continues to sin, it will affect more and more of his life until it causes his death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JAS 1 15 j036 figs-metaphor ἀποκύει θάνατον 1 gives birth to death Here, **death** could mean: (1) spiritual death, that is, separation from God. This is the interpretation in UST. (2) physical death. Alternate translation: “causes the person to die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 16 v195 figs-metaphor μὴ πλανᾶσθε 1 Do not be led astray James is speaking figuratively as if some deceptive guides were trying to lead his readers in the wrong direction. Alternate translation: “Do not be deceived” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 16 j037 figs-activepassive μὴ πλανᾶσθε 1 Do not be led astray If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. The meaning here is probably not truly passive. That is, even though James speaks as if someone else might lead his readers astray, that is probably not what he means. This could be: (1) a warning James’ readers not to lead themselves astray, that is, not to deceive themselves. That is the interpretation in UST. (2) a simple active meaning. Alternate translation: “Make no mistake about this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JAS 1 16 j038 figs-explicit μὴ πλανᾶσθε 1 Do not be led astray James is referring back to his statement in [1:13](../01/13.md) that God never desires to do evil and that God never leads anyone to do evil. Instead, as James will say in the next two verses, God gives only good things to people. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this connection more explicit. Alternate translation: “Do not deceive yourselves, God is not evil, God is good” or “Make no mistake about this, God is not evil, God is good” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 1 16 j039 figs-metaphor ἀδελφοί μου ἀγαπητοί 1 my beloved brothers See how you translated the term **brothers** in [1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: “my dear fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 17 j040 figs-metaphor πᾶσα δόσις ἀγαθὴ, καὶ πᾶν δώρημα τέλειον, ἄνωθέν ἐστιν 1 Every good present and every perfect gift is from above Here, **from above** is a spatial metaphor that figuratively describes God. Alternate translation: “God gives us every good present and every perfect gift” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 17 t2nn figs-doublet πᾶσα δόσις ἀγαθὴ, καὶ πᾶν δώρημα τέλειον, ἄνωθέν ἐστιν 1 Every good present and every perfect gift is from above The phrases **good present** and **perfect gift** mean similar things. James is using them together for emphasis. (As in [1:4](../01/04.md), the word **perfect** refers to something that has developed to the point where it is fully suited to its purpose.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate both phrases with a single expression. Alternate translation: “God gives us the things that are just right for us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
JAS 1 17 j041 figs-metaphor καταβαῖνον ἀπὸ 1 coming down from Continuing the spatial metaphor, James speaks figuratively of these gifts **coming down from** God. If you use a non-figurative expression to translate this, it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They come to us from” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 17 n7d8 figs-metaphor τοῦ Πατρὸς τῶν φώτων 1 the Father of lights Here, **lights** likely means the lights in the sky, that is, the sun, moon, and stars. James says figuratively that God is their **Father** because he created them. Alternate translation: “God, who created all the lights in the sky” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 17 j042 figs-doublet παρ’ ᾧ οὐκ ἔνι παραλλαγὴ ἢ τροπῆς ἀποσκίασμα 1 with whom there is no change or shadow of turning Here, **change** and **shadow of turning** mean similar things. James is using repetition for emphasis. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them into a single phrase and express the metaphor of a **shadow** (see later note) as a simile. It may also be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God does not change as shifting shadows do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
JAS 1 17 j043 figs-possession τροπῆς ἀποσκίασμα 1 shadow of turning James is using the possessive form to describe a **shadow** that is characterized by **turning**. Alternate translation: “shadow that turns” or “shadow that changes position” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JAS 1 17 j044 figs-explicit τροπῆς ἀποσκίασμα 1 shadow of turning James is contrasting God, the Creator of the lights in the sky, with those lights themselves, which are not as great as their Creator. They create shadows that change position, but God never deviates from wanting only good things for people. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “turning shadow such as the sun or moon casts. No, God always wants good things for people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 1 17 g5ge figs-metaphor τροπῆς ἀποσκίασμα 1 shadow of turning There could not literally be a **shadow** in God, so this is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “variability” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 18 j045  βουληθεὶς, ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς 1 Having willed, he gave birth to us Alternate translation: “God chose to give birth to us”
JAS 1 18 mj29 figs-metaphor βουληθεὶς, ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς 1 Having willed, he gave birth to us James says figuratively that God **gave birth to us** because God gives spiritual life to everyone who believes in Jesus. Alternate translation: “God chose to give us spiritual life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 18 j046 figs-exclusive ἡμᾶς…ἡμᾶς 1 us … us Here and throughout this letter, James uses the pronoun **us** to refer to himself and his readers. Sometimes by extension he also means all believers or all people. In every case, therefore, the pronoun **us** is inclusive, so use the inclusive form if your language makes that distinction. The same applies to the pronoun “our.” However, in some cases the pronoun “we” is exclusive. Notes will identify those places. Everywhere else, the pronoun “we” is inclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
JAS 1 18 j047 figs-possession λόγῳ ἀληθείας 1 by the word of truth James is using the possessive form to describe a **word** that is characterized by **truth**. Alternate translation: “by the true word” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JAS 1 18 ykq9 figs-metonymy λόγῳ ἀληθείας 1 by the word of truth James is using term **word** figuratively to describe the message about Jesus that was conveyed by using words. Alternate translation: “by the true message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 1 18 j048 figs-abstractnouns λόγῳ ἀληθείας 1 by the word of truth If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind the abstract noun **truth** with an equivalent expression that uses an adjective such as “true.” Alternate translation: “when we believed the true message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 18 j049 figs-explicit λόγῳ ἀληθείας 1 by the word of truth James is referring implicitly to the message about Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “when we believed the true message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 1 18 j346 grammar-connect-logic-goal εἰς τὸ εἶναι ἡμᾶς ἀπαρχήν τινα τῶν αὐτοῦ κτισμάτων 1 for us to be something like a firstfruits of his creatures This is a purpose clause. James is stating the purpose for which God **desired to give us birth**. In your translation, follow the conventions of your language for purpose clauses. Alternate translation (without a comma preceding): “so that we would be like a firstfruits of his creatures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
JAS 1 18 j050 figs-explicit ἀπαρχήν τινα τῶν αὐτοῦ κτισμάτων 1 something like a firstfruits of his creatures James is assuming that his readers will know that he is using the traditional Israelite offering known as **firstfruits** as a simile. The law of Moses required the Israelites to offer to God some of the first crops they harvested each year. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state specifically that this is the name of an offering. Alternate translation: “something like an offering of firstfruits from among his creatures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 1 18 qh2e figs-simile ἀπαρχήν τινα τῶν αὐτοῦ κτισμάτων 1 something like a firstfruits of his creatures When they offered some of their first crops to God each year, the Israelites were acknowledging that the entire crop belonged to God and was a gift from God to them. James is using this **firstfruits** offering as a simile to indicate that the believers of his time are an indication that there will be many more people who will belong to God in the future. In fact, since James speaks of **creatures**, he may even mean that believers in Jesus are the first part of God’s creation to be freed from the curse and come back fully under his rule. Alternate translation: “the first of many people who would believe in Jesus” or “the first of God’s creatures to be freed from the curse and come back fully under his rule” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
JAS 1 19 dt7i figs-sentencetypes ἴστε 1 Know This Greek form could be either imperative or indicative, and so it could mean: (1) if it is an imperative, James is telling his readers to pay attention to what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “This is important” (2) if it is an indicative, James is telling his readers that he is about to remind them of something that they already know. Alternate translation: “You already know this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-sentencetypes]])
JAS 1 19 j051 figs-metaphor ἀδελφοί μου ἀγαπητοί 1 my beloved brothers See how you translated this expression in [1:16](../01/16.md). Alternate translation: “my dear fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 19 j052 grammar-connect-logic-contrast δὲ 1 But **But** could mean: (1) if **know** is an imperative, then James is using the term **but** as a transitional particle that does not indicate a contrast. If you decided to translate **know** as an imperative, you may have a similar word in your language that you can use for this same purpose. Otherwise, you do not need to translate the term. (2) if **know** is an indicative, then James is using the term **but** to introduce a mild contrast. He is saying that even though his readers already know what he is about to say, he wants to stress it anyway. If you decided to translate **know** as an indicative, you could use a term in your language that indicates a mild contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

Rather, like the expressions before and after it, it is an idiom. Alternate translation: “each of you should listen carefully, speak only after reflecting on what to say, and not lose your tempers easily” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 1 19 ev3v figs-gendernotations πᾶς ἄνθρωπος 1 every man James is using the term **man** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “each of you” or “each person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
JAS 1 20 j053 grammar-connect-logic-result γὰρ 1 For James is giving the reason why people should not get angry, as he said in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “You should not get angry, because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JAS 1 20 j054 figs-gendernotations ὀργὴ…ἀνδρὸς 1 the anger of man James is using the term **man** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “human anger” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
JAS 1 20 ej4p figs-abstractnouns δικαιοσύνην Θεοῦ οὐκ ἐργάζεται 1 does not work the righteousness of God If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind the abstract noun **righteousness** with an adjective such as “righteous” or “right.” Alternate translation: “does not fulfill the righteous purposes of God” or “does not accomplish the right things that God wants to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 21 j055 grammar-connect-logic-result διὸ 1 Therefore Here James is telling his readers what they should do as a result of what he explained to them in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “Consequently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JAS 1 21 hit5 figs-metaphor ἀποθέμενοι πᾶσαν ῥυπαρίαν καὶ περισσείαν κακίας 1 laying aside all filth and abundance of wickedness James is speaking of **filth** and **abundance of wickedness** as if they were clothing that could be taken off. By those expressions he means sin and wrong actions (see later notes to this verse). Alternate translation: “stop committing sin and doing so many wrong things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 21 h226 figs-doublet ῥυπαρίαν καὶ περισσείαν κακίας 1 filth and abundance of wickedness The expressions **filth** and **abundance of wickedness** mean similar things. James is using them together for emphasis. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them into a single phrase. Alternate translation: “every kind of sinful behavior” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
JAS 1 21 h8ty figs-metaphor ῥυπαρίαν 1 filth James is speaking figuratively of sin as if it were **filth**, that is, something that made people dirty. Alternate translation: “sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 21 j056 figs-abstractnouns περισσείαν κακίας 1 abundance of wickedness If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind the abstract noun **wickedness** with an adjective such as “wrong.” Alternate translation: “the many wrong things that people do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 21 a3u3 figs-abstractnouns ἐν πραΰτητι 1 in humility If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind the abstract noun **humility** with an adverb such as “humbly.” Alternate translation: “humbly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 21 i9w1 figs-metaphor δέξασθε τὸν ἔμφυτον λόγον 1 receive the implanted word The word **implanted** describes something that has been placed inside another thing. James is speaking of God’s word figuratively as if it had been planted and was growing inside believers. Alternate translation: “obey the word that you have heard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 21 j057 figs-metonymy δέξασθε τὸν ἔμφυτον λόγον 1 receive the implanted word James is using term **word** figuratively to describe the message about Jesus that was conveyed by using words. Alternate translation: “obey the message about Jesus that you have heard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 1 21 ekl3 figs-personification τὸν δυνάμενον σῶσαι τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν 1 which is able to save your souls James is speaking figuratively of the **word** or message as if it were a living thing that could actively **save** believers. He means that obedience to the message will lead to salvation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “If you do that, you will be saved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JAS 1 21 z73e figs-synecdoche τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν 1 your souls James is figuratively referring to one part of his readers, their **souls**, to mean their whole beings. Alternate translation: “you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
JAS 1 22 j058 grammar-connect-logic-contrast δὲ 1 But **But** draws a contrast not with what James has just said, but with a potential misunderstanding of what he has just said. He wants to clarify that by “receive the implanted word” he does not mean simply to believe it, but to put it into practice. It may be appropriate in your language to translate the word **but** with an expression that introduces a clarification. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
JAS 1 22 j059 figs-ellipsis γίνεσθε δὲ ποιηταὶ λόγου, καὶ μὴ μόνον ἀκροαταὶ 1 be doers of the word and not only hearers At the end of this clause, James is leaving out some of the words that it would need in many languages in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from earlier in the clause. Alternate translation: “be doers of the word and not only hearers of the word” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JAS 1 22 x14m figs-metonymy γίνεσθε…ποιηταὶ λόγου, καὶ μὴ μόνον ἀκροαταὶ 1 be doers of the word and not only hearers James is using the term **word** figuratively to describe the message about Jesus that was conveyed by using words. Alternate translation: “obey the message about Jesus, do not just listen to it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 1 22 wvp4 figs-idiom καὶ μὴ μόνον ἀκροαταὶ 1 and not only hearers In the Bible, the word “hear” often has the idiomatic sense of agreeing with what is heard. James may be using the word in that sense. Alternate translation: “and do not just decide that you agree with it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 1 23 j060 figs-hypo ὅτι εἴ τις ἀκροατὴς λόγου ἐστὶν, καὶ οὐ ποιητής, οὗτος ἔοικεν ἀνδρὶ κατανοοῦντι τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γενέσεως αὐτοῦ ἐν ἐσόπτρῳ 1 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man beholding the face of his birth in a mirror James is using a hypothetical situation to teach. Alternate translation: “Suppose someone is a hearer of the word and not a doer. Then he is like a man beholding the face of his birth in a mirror” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
JAS 1 23 r6pp figs-ellipsis ἀκροατὴς λόγου ἐστὶν, καὶ οὐ ποιητής 1 is a hearer of the word and not a doer At the end of this clause, James is leaving out some of the words that it would need in many languages in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from earlier in the clause. Alternate translation: “is a hearer of the word and not a doer of the word” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JAS 1 23 j061 figs-idiom ἀκροατὴς λόγου ἐστὶν, καὶ οὐ ποιητής 1 is a hearer of the word and not a doer See how you translated these expressions in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “just listens to the word but does not obey it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

JAS 1 23 pw5x figs-simile οὗτος ἔοικεν ἀνδρὶ κατανοοῦντι τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γενέσεως αὐτοῦ ἐν ἐσόπτρῳ 1 he is like a man beholding the face of his birth in a mirror Here James begins a simile, an illustrative comparison, that continues through the next two verses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
JAS 1 23 j063 figs-gendernotations ἀνδρὶ 1 a man James is using the term **man** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “a person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
JAS 1 23 shn9 figs-idiom τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γενέσεως αὐτοῦ 1 the face of his birth This is an idiom that refers to the **face** a person was born with, that is, that person’s natural or physical face. Since the term “face” had many figurative meanings at this time, James is using this idiomatic expression to clarify that he means the hypothetical person’s literal, physical face. You may not need to make this clarification in your language. Alternate translation: “his physical face” or “his face” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 1 23 j064 translate-unknown ἐν ἐσόπτρῳ 1 in a mirror A **mirror** is a flat object made of some reflective material, such as glass or polished metal, that people use to see what they look like. If your readers would not be familiar with what a **mirror** is, you could use the name of something else that serves this purpose in your culture. Alternate translation: “reflected in the water” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
JAS 1 24 j065 figs-explicit γὰρ 1 For **For** introduces a reason, as would be expected, but it is a reason for something that must be inferred from the context. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly what James is giving the reason for. Alternate translation: “This did not really benefit him, because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 1 24 wu34  κατενόησεν…ἑαυτὸν καὶ ἀπελήλυθεν, καὶ εὐθέως ἐπελάθετο ὁποῖος ἦν 1 he beheld himself and went away and immediately forgot of what sort he was Here James is giving an illustration in the past tense as if he were telling the story of something that had happened. (See the discussion of this in Part 3 of the Introduction to James.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this with the present tense. Alternate translation: “he beholds himself and goes away and immediately forgets of what sort he is”
JAS 1 24 j066 writing-pronouns κατενόησεν…ἑαυτὸν 1 he beheld himself James is continuing the simile he began in the previous verse, so the pronouns **he** and **himself** refer to the hypothetical person who looks in the mirror. Alternate translation (using the present tense): “such a person looked at himself in a mirror” or, if you are using the present tense, “such a person looks at himself in a mirror” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JAS 1 24 j067 figs-explicit καὶ ἀπελήλυθεν, καὶ εὐθέως ἐπελάθετο ὁποῖος ἦν 1 and went away and immediately forgot of what sort he was James is saying implicitly that this is a person who sees but does not do, just like a person who hears the word of God but does not obey it. The implication is that he sees in the mirror that he needs to do something such as wash his face or fix his hair. But because he does not do that when he is looking in the mirror, when he walks away, he forgets to do it. The point of the comparison is that a person who does not obey God’s word is like this. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain that explicitly. Alternate translation: “but because he did not immediately do what he saw he should do, when he walked away from the mirror, he forgot what he saw and so he did nothing about it” or, if you are using the present tense, “but because he does not immediately do what he sees he should do, when he walks away from the mirror, he forgets what he saw and so he does nothing about it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 1 24 j068  ὁποῖος ἦν 1 of what sort he was Alternate translation: “what he needed to do about his appearance” or, if you are using the present tense, “what he needs to do about his appearance”
JAS 1 25 j069 figs-hypo ὁ δὲ παρακύψας εἰς νόμον τέλειον, τὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας, καὶ παραμείνας…οὗτος μακάριος…ἔσται 1 But the one having gazed into the perfect law of freedom and having continued … this one will be blessed James is using a further hypothetical situation to teach. This illustration is a contrast to the one he offered in [1:23](../01/23.md). Alternate translation: “But suppose someone gazes into the perfect law of freedom and perseveres …. Then that person will be blessed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
JAS 1 25 kvr7 figs-metaphor ὁ…παρακύψας εἰς νόμον τέλειον 1 the one having gazed into the perfect law In this verse, James continues to compare hearing the word of God to looking in a mirror. But the image now becomes a metaphor rather than a simile, since James speaks figuratively about someone who has **gazed into** the **law**. He means someone who has listened attentively to God’s word. Alternate translation: “someone who has listened attentively to the perfect law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 25 j070 figs-possession νόμον τέλειον, τὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας 1 the perfect law of freedom James is using the possessive form to describe a **law** that brings **freedom**. See the notes to [2:12](../02/12.md) for a further explanation of what James means by the **law of freedom**. Alternate translation: “the perfect law that brings freedom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JAS 1 25 sf8k figs-abstractnouns νόμον τέλειον, τὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας 1 the perfect law of freedom If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind the abstract noun **freedom** with an adjective such as “free.” Alternate translation: “the perfect law that sets people free” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 25 j071 figs-explicit νόμον τέλειον, τὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας 1 the perfect law of freedom If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly what this **law** gives people the **freedom** to do. Alternate translation: “the law that sets people free to obey God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 1 25 j072  νόμον τέλειον, τὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας 1 the perfect law of freedom As in [1:4](../01/04.md) and [1:17](../01/17.md), the term **perfect** refers to something that has developed to the point where it is fully suited to its purpose. See how you translated the term in those verses. Alternate translation: “the law that is perfectly suited to set people free from sin”
JAS 1 25 j073 figs-ellipsis καὶ παραμείνας 1 and having continued James is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from the context. Alternate translation: “and who has continued to obey that law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JAS 1 25 j074 figs-possession ἀκροατὴς ἐπιλησμονῆς 1 a hearer of forgetfulness James is using the possessive form to describe a **hearer** who is characterized by **forgetfulness**. Alternate translation: “a hearer who is forgetful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JAS 1 25 j075 figs-abstractnouns ἀκροατὴς ἐπιλησμονῆς 1 a hearer of forgetfulness If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind the abstract noun **forgetfulness** with a verb such as “forget.” Alternate translation: “a hearer who forgets” or “someone who forgets what he hears” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 25 j076 figs-metonymy ποιητὴς ἔργου 1 a doer of the work By association with the **work** that it takes to carry out God’s commands, James is using the term **work** figuratively to mean what God commands. Alternate translation: “someone who does what God commands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 1 25 jku1 figs-activepassive οὗτος μακάριος…αὐτοῦ ἔσται 1 this one will be blessed While the word **blessed** is an adjective and so the expression **will be blessed** is not a passive verbal form, it may be clearer in your language to translate this with an active verbal form. Alternate translation: “God will bless such a person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JAS 1 25 j077 figs-abstractnouns ἐν τῇ ποιήσει αὐτοῦ 1 in his doing If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind the abstract noun **doing** with a verb such as “do.” Alternate translation: “in what he does” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 1 26 j078 figs-hypo εἴ τις δοκεῖ θρησκὸς εἶναι, μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσσαν αὐτοῦ, ἀλλὰ ἀπατῶν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ, τούτου μάταιος ἡ θρησκεία 1 If anyone thinks to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his heart, the religion of that one is worthless James is using a hypothetical situation to teach. Alternate translation: “Suppose someone thinks that he is religious, but he does not bridle his tongue, thus deceiving his heart. Then his religion is worthless” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
JAS 1 26 j1bg  δοκεῖ θρησκὸς εἶναι 1 thinks to be religious The word translated **religious** could refer to a pattern of behavior rather than to participation in worship activities. Alternate translation: “thinks that he is honoring God by his actions”
JAS 1 26 j079 figs-metaphor μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσσαν αὐτοῦ 1 not bridling his tongue James speaks figuratively of a person **bridling his tongue** as if he were controlling a horse with a bridle. Alternate translation: “but he does not control his tongue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 26 j080 translate-unknown μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσσαν αὐτοῦ 1 not bridling his tongue A **bridle** is headgear that is used to control a horse. If your readers would not be familiar with what a **bridle** is, you could use a different illustration that would be familiar to them of a device that is used in your culture to control animals. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
JAS 1 26 vxu1 figs-metonymy μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσσαν αὐτοῦ 1 not bridling his tongue By association with the way that the **tongue** is used in speech, James is using the term **tongue** figuratively to mean what a person says. Alternate translation: “not controlling what he says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 1 26 sex6 figs-synecdoche ἀπατῶν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ 1 deceiving his heart James is figuratively using one part of this hypothetical person, his **heart**, to mean the person himself. Alternate translation: “deceiving himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
JAS 1 26 q83d figs-hyperbole τούτου μάταιος ἡ θρησκεία 1 the religion of that one is worthless James says **worthless** as an overstatement for emphasis. There would conceivably still be some value in the religion of a person even if he did not carefully control what he said. But James wants to emphasize how inconsistent it is to claim to love God but then to say things that hurt and disparage other people. He will develop this point further in [3:9-10](../03/09.md). Alternate translation: “his actions are not as pleasing to God as he thinks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
JAS 1 27 j081 figs-metaphor θρησκεία καθαρὰ καὶ ἀμίαντος 1 Pure and undefiled religion James is speaking figuratively of **religion** as if it could be physically **pure** and **undefiled**. Alternate translation: “Religion that is pleasing and acceptable” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 27 g11k figs-doublet θρησκεία καθαρὰ καὶ ἀμίαντος 1 Pure and undefiled religion The terms **pure** and **undefiled** mean similar things. They both indicate that something is free of contamination. James is using these terms together for emphasis. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them into a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Religion that is completely acceptable” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
JAS 1 27 skf4 figs-metaphor παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ 1 before God The word **before** means “in front of” or “in the presence of” another person, and in this case **before** him indicates “where God can see.” Seeing, for its part, represents attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “from God’s perspective” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 1 27 j082 figs-hendiadys τῷ Θεῷ καὶ Πατρί 1 God and the Father James is not talking about two different people. He is expressing a single idea by using two nouns connected with **and**. The noun **Father** further identifies **God**. Alternate translation: “God the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
JAS 1 27 j083 guidelines-sonofgodprinciples Πατρί 1 the Father **Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

JAS 1 27 r8nj figs-explicit ἐπισκέπτεσθαι ὀρφανοὺς καὶ χήρας ἐν τῇ θλίψει αὐτῶν 1 to look upon orphans and widows in their distress James assumes that his readers will know that orphans and widows are in practical and financial **distress** because their fathers or husbands have died and so are no longer providing for them. In this culture, women and children were dependent on male relatives for support. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly what kind of **distress** James wants his readers to help relieve. Alternate translation: “to help poor orphans and widows with their practical needs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 1 27 j084  ἄσπιλον ἑαυτὸν τηρεῖν ἀπὸ τοῦ κόσμου 1 to keep oneself unstained by the world This is not a purpose or result clause. James is not telling his readers that they should help **orphans and widows** in order to stay **unstained by the world** or that this would be the result if they did help them. Rather, James is saying that this is a second thing that characterizes **religion** that pleases God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could add the word “and” before this clause in order to clarify this.
JAS 1 27 j085 figs-metonymy ἄσπιλον ἑαυτὸν τηρεῖν ἀπὸ τοῦ κόσμου 1 to keep oneself unstained by the world James is using the term **world** figuratively to mean the system of values shared by people who do not honor God, by association with the way those people live in the world. Alternate translation: “to keep oneself unstained by the value system of ungodly people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 1 27 nmf7 figs-metaphor ἄσπιλον ἑαυτὸν τηρεῖν ἀπὸ τοῦ κόσμου 1 to keep oneself unstained by the world James is speaking figuratively of the influence of ungodly people as if it could physically stain a person. By **unstained** he actually means free from sin. Alternate translation: “not to allow ungodly people and their influence to cause oneself to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 2 intro f5zd   0  # James 2 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. A warning against favoring rich people (2:1-13)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Faith and works (2:14-26)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Favoritism&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Some of James’s readers treated rich and powerful people well and they treated poor people badly. Treating some people better than others is called favoritism. James tells his readers that this is wrong. God wants his people to treat everyone well.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Justification&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Justification is what happens when God makes a person righteous, that is, when God puts a person in right standing with himself. James says in this chapter that God justifies people when they do good works along with having faith. But that is because the good works demonstrate the faith that a person has, as James says explicitly in [2:18](../02/18.md). James is not saying that people need to add good works to their faith in order to be justified. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### But someone may say, “You have faith, and I have works” (2:18)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;When James says this, he seems to be raising an objection that someone might make to what he has been saying. Public speakers at this time commonly raised such objections in order to answer them, and James is probably using that device. However, if that is what he is doing, we would expect the objection to be, “You have works, and I have faith,” since James has been stressing the importance of works accompanying faith. So why does this hypothetical speaker say instead, “You have faith, and I have works”?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;It appears that James actually has this speaker addressing these words to the same “you” whom he has been addressing himself since 2:16 as “one of you” and whom he then goes on to address in the rest of this chapter. In other words, James is raising this hypothetical objection so that he can address this same “you” in this verse as well. James is saying, “Someone might reassure you that you nevertheless have faith, while I (James) have works. He might argue that both are valid expressions of religion and that it is not necessary for a person to have both.” James then answers this argument by observing that he can show his faith through his works, while a person who claims to have faith but not works has no means of proving that.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In your translation, you may wish to express this implicit information, as UST does. Alternatively, you may wish to translate as ULT does and leave it to Bible teachers and preachers to explain the meaning. See the further discussion in the notes to [2:18](../02/18.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Major textual issues in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Faith without works is “useless” or “dead” (2:20)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In James [2:20](../02/20.md), some ancient manuscripts say that faith without works is “useless.” ULT and UST follow that reading. Some other ancient manuscripts say that it is “dead,” perhaps under the influence of [2:17](../02/17.md) and [2:26](../02/26.md), where James uses the term “dead” to describe faith that is not expressed in works. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, consider using the reading found in that translation. If not, we recommend that you follow the reading of ULT and UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
JAS 2 1 kab4 figs-metaphor ἀδελφοί μου 1 My brothers See how you translated the term **brothers** in [1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: “My fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 2 1 en1c figs-abstractnouns μὴ ἐν προσωπολημψίαις ἔχετε 1 do not with favoritism have If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **favoritism** with an equivalent phrase. (See the discussion of favoritism in the General Notes to this chapter.) Alternate translation: “you should not treat some people better than others, because that is not consistent with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 2 1 qs2x figs-possession τὴν πίστιν τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ 1 the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ James is using the possessive form to refer to **faith** that other people have in **Jesus**. Alternate translation: “faith in our Lord Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JAS 2 1 x32n figs-possession τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, τῆς δόξης 1 our Lord Jesus Christ of glory James is using the possessive form to describe **Jesus** as characterized by **glory**. Alternate translation: “our glorious Lord Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JAS 2 2 h5uh figs-hypo ἐὰν γὰρ 1 For if James is using a hypothetical situation to teach. He describes the condition in this verse and the next verse, and he describes the result in [2:4](../02/04.md). Alternate translation: “Suppose” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
JAS 2 2 j8d5 figs-explicit ἀνὴρ χρυσοδακτύλιος, ἐν ἐσθῆτι λαμπρᾷ 1 a gold-ringed man in splendid clothing James assumes that his readers will know that he is giving an example of what a wealthy person might wear. (The expression **a gold-ringed man** does not mean a man who is ringed around with gold, but a man who is wearing a gold ring.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a different example from your own culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “someone who is dressed like a wealthy person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 2 j086 figs-gendernotations ἀνὴρ 1 man James is using the term **man** in a generic sense that could mean either a man or a woman. Alternate translation: “person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
JAS 2 2 j087 translate-unknown συναγωγὴν 1 synagogue A **synagogue** is a Jewish meeting place for worship. James uses the term because he is writing primarily to Jews who have put their faith in Jesus as their Messiah. (See the discussion in Part 1 of the Introduction to James.) In your translation you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “meeting place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
JAS 2 2 j088 figs-nominaladj πτωχὸς 1 a poor one James is using the adjective **poor** as a noun in order to mean a kind of person. (ULT adds **one** to indicate this.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a person who is poor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
JAS 2 3 j089 figs-hypo δὲ 1 and James is continuing to describe the condition in the hypothetical situation that he introduced in the previous verse. Alternate translation, as in UST: “and suppose” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
JAS 2 3 j090 figs-you ἐπιβλέψητε…εἴπητε…εἴπητε 1 you look … you say … you say In these three instances **you** is plural, since James is speaking to all of his readers about what they might do in such a situation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
JAS 2 3 j091 figs-idiom ἐπιβλέψητε…ἐπὶ 1 you look at In this context, this expression means to look at someone or something with admiration. Alternate translation: “you look admiringly at” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 2 3 j092 figs-yousingular σὺ κάθου ὧδε καλῶς…σὺ στῆθι ἐκεῖ…κάθου ὑπὸ τὸ ὑποπόδιόν μου 1 You sit here well … You stand there … Sit under my footstool Since these comments are addressed to the rich person and to the poor person as individuals, **you** is singular in the first two instances and the implied “you” in the command to **sit** is also singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
JAS 2 3 zx9f figs-idiom σὺ κάθου ὧδε καλῶς 1 You sit here well In this context **well** means “honorably.” It does not refer to how well the rich person would be able to sit in the indicated seat. Alternate translation: “Sit here in this place of honor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 2 3 j093 figs-imperative σὺ κάθου ὧδε καλῶς 1 You sit here well This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please sit here in this place of honor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
JAS 2 3 j094 grammar-connect-logic-contrast καὶ 1 and The term **and** introduces a contrast between the way the rich person and the poor person are treated. Alternate translation: “but” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
JAS 2 3 j095 figs-imperative σὺ στῆθι ἐκεῖ…κάθου ὑπὸ τὸ ὑποπόδιόν μου 1 You stand there … Sit under my footstool These statements addressed to the poor person probably are direct imperatives rather than polite requests, since James is illustrating how believers might treat poor people differently from rich people. Not adding “please” to these statements would show the contrast with the way the rich person is addressed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
JAS 2 3 ce14 figs-explicit σὺ στῆθι ἐκεῖ…κάθου ὑπὸ τὸ ὑποπόδιόν μου 1 You stand there … Sit under my footstool The implications are that the poor person is being told to stand or sit in a humbler and less honorable place. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 3 h2fy figs-you κάθου ὑπὸ τὸ ὑποπόδιόν μου 1 Sit under my footstool This imperative statement uses the singular first-person pronoun **my**, since it is something that one of the believers might say to the hypothetical poor person. If this would not be natural in your language, since the statement is introduced by **you** (plural) **say**, you could also use a plural form in the statement itself. Alternate translation: “Sit on the floor by our feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
JAS 2 4 j096 figs-hypo οὐ διεκρίθητε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς, καὶ ἐγένεσθε κριταὶ διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν? 1 have you not distinguished among yourselves and become judges of evil thoughts? In this verse James describes the result of the hypothetical situation he has been describing since [2:2](../02/02.md). It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Then you have distinguished among yourselves and become judges of evil thoughts.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
JAS 2 4 j097 grammar-connect-logic-result οὐ διεκρίθητε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς, καὶ ἐγένεσθε κριταὶ διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν 1 have you not distinguished among yourselves and become judges of evil thoughts If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “have you not become judges who think evil things and so begun to consider some people better than others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JAS 2 4 x9el figs-rquestion οὐ διεκρίθητε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς, καὶ ἐγένεσθε κριταὶ διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν? 1 have you not distinguished among yourselves and become judges of evil thoughts? As James describes this result, he uses the question form for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “you have considered some people better than others, because you have become judges who think evil things!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JAS 2 4 j098 figs-possession ἐγένεσθε κριταὶ διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν 1 become judges of evil thoughts James is using the possessive form to describe **judges** who are characterized by **evil thoughts**. He is not speaking of people who judge whether thoughts are evil. Alternate translation: “become judges who think evil things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JAS 2 4 j099 figs-explicit ἐγένεσθε κριταὶ διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν 1 become judges of evil thoughts James is describing something more than passively assuming a certain role and thinking in a certain way. He is describing taking action based on that way of thinking. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “made wrong judgments about how people should be treated and then treated them that way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 5 j344 figs-idiom ἀκούσατε 1 Listen James uses this expression to emphasize what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Pay attention to this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 2 5 m5jr figs-metaphor ἀδελφοί μου ἀγαπητοί 1 my beloved brothers See how you translated this in [1:16](../01/16.md). Alternate translation: “my dear fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

James is using the question form as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “God has chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JAS 2 5 ke2q figs-nominaladj τοὺς πτωχοὺς 1 the poor James is using the adjective **poor** as a noun to refer to a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are poor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
JAS 2 5 j100 figs-metonymy τῷ κόσμῳ 1 in the world James is using the term **world** in a different sense than in 1:27. Here it refers to the world that we live in, and so it indicates ordinary life. Alternate translation: “in this life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 2 5 s38z figs-metaphor πλουσίους ἐν πίστει 1 to be rich in faith James speaks figuratively of having much **faith** as if that made a person wealthy. Alternate translation: “to have strong faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 2 5 j101 figs-explicit πλουσίους ἐν πίστει 1 to be rich in faith Your language may require you to specify the object of **faith**. Alternate translation: “to have strong faith in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 5 qii5 figs-metaphor κληρονόμους τῆς βασιλείας ἧς 1 heirs of the kingdom that James speaks figuratively of the people to whom God has promised the kingdom as if they were going to inherit wealth from a family member. Alternate translation: “participants in the kingdom that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 2 5 j102 figs-abstractnouns κληρονόμους τῆς βασιλείας ἧς 1 to be heirs of the kingdom that If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “to enjoy advantages when God rules, as” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 2 6 vr53  ἠτιμάσατε τὸν πτωχόν 1 you have dishonored the poor What James means by this is clear from the example he gives in [2:2-3](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: “you have treated people who are poor much worse than you have treated people who are rich”
JAS 2 6 j103 figs-nominaladj τὸν πτωχόν 1 the poor James is using the adjective **poor** as a noun to refer to a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are poor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
JAS 2 6 j104 writing-pronouns οὐχ οἱ πλούσιοι καταδυναστεύουσιν ὑμῶν, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἕλκουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς κριτήρια 1 Do not the rich overpower you and themselves drag you into court The word that is translated **themselves** here is the same word that is translated **they** in the next verse. It is effectively the subject of a new independent clause, so you could translate this as two sentences. Alternate translation: “Do not the rich overpower you? Do they not drag you into court” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JAS 2 6 l2lu figs-rquestion οὐχ οἱ πλούσιοι καταδυναστεύουσιν ὑμῶν, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἕλκουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς κριτήρια? 1 Do not the rich overpower you and themselves drag you into court? James is using the question form as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “It is the rich who overpower you and drag you into court themselves!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JAS 2 6 j105 figs-explicit οὐχ οἱ πλούσιοι καταδυναστεύουσιν ὑμῶν, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἕλκουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς κριτήρια? 1 Do not the rich overpower you and themselves drag you into court? James is implying that rich people do not deserve to be treated better by the believers to whom he is writing, since rich people have actually treated them badly. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “People who are rich do not deserve to have you treat them better than others. They are the ones who overpower you and drag you into court themselves!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 6 eeg5 figs-nominaladj οἱ πλούσιοι 1 the rich James is using the adjective **rich** as a noun to refer to a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

JAS 2 6 s9k1 figs-metaphor ἕλκουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς κριτήρια 1 drag you into court James is speaking figuratively of the rich as if they would physically **drag** the poor into court. Alternate translation: “force you to go to court” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 2 6 h8jn figs-explicit ἕλκουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς κριτήρια 1 drag you into court If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly why rich people were taking poor people to court. Alternate translation: “force you to go to court so that they can exploit you through lawsuits” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 7 las1 figs-rquestion οὐκ αὐτοὶ βλασφημοῦσιν τὸ καλὸν ὄνομα τὸ ἐπικληθὲν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς? 1 Do they not blaspheme the good name that has been called upon you? James is using the question form as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “They are the ones who blaspheme the good name that has been called upon you!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JAS 2 7 j106  οὐκ αὐτοὶ βλασφημοῦσιν τὸ καλὸν ὄνομα 1 Do they not blaspheme the good name The word **blaspheme** can have a technical sense. It can describe a human being wrongly denying that something is divine. But the word can also have the general sense of “insult,” and that is probably the sense in which James is using it here. (However, by insulting the **name** of Jesus, these rich people were also guilty of blasphemy in the technical sense, since Jesus is divine and his name should be honored.) Alternate translation: “Do they not insult the good name”
JAS 2 7 wd8y figs-metonymy τὸ καλὸν ὄνομα 1 the good name James is referring figuratively to the **name** of Jesus by association with the way that it is **good**. Alternate translation: “the name of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 2 7 j107 figs-idiom τὸ ἐπικληθὲν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς 1 that has been called upon you This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “by which you are called” or “by which you are known” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 2 7 j108 figs-activepassive τὸ ἐπικληθὲν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς 1 that has been called upon you If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “by which people call you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JAS 2 8 j109 grammar-connect-logic-contrast εἰ μέντοι 1 If, however James is using these words to introduce a contrast with what he said in [2:6](../02/06.md), “you have dishonored the poor,” meaning “you have treated rich people much better than you have treated poor people.” Alternate translation: “But if, instead of favoring rich people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
JAS 2 8 j110  τελεῖτε 1 you fulfill The verb **fulfill** comes from the same root as the adjective “perfect” that James uses several times earlier in this letter. It means to make something accomplish its purpose or reach its goal. Alternate translation: “you completely obey”
JAS 2 8 q9hh figs-metonymy νόμον…βασιλικὸν 1 the royal law There are two possible reasons for why James describes the **law** that he quotes here from [Leviticus 19:18](../lev/19/18.md) as **royal**. (1) When Jesus came proclaiming the kingdom of God, he said that this law was one of two that summed up all of the other laws and guided life in the kingdom of God. (The other law was to love God with all of one’s heart, soul, mind, and strength.) Alternate translation: “the law that guides life in the kingdom of God” (2) James may say that this **law** is **royal** because God, the true king, gave it to people. Alternate translation: “God’s law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 2 8 ymf5 figs-declarative ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν 1 You will love your neighbor as yourself Here the law of Moses is using a future statement to give a command.

JAS 2 8 j111 figs-youcrowd ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν 1 You will love your neighbor as yourself The words **you** and **yourself** are singular in this quotation because, even though Moses gave this law to the Israelites as a group, each individual person was expected to obey it. So in your translation, use the singular forms of “you” and “yourself” if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
JAS 2 8 gll2 figs-idiom τὸν πλησίον σου 1 your neighbor This is an idiom. It does not mean only someone who lives nearby. Alternate translation: “other people” or “anyone you encounter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Alternate translation: “but disobey one thing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 2 10 m8ep figs-nominaladj πταίσῃ δὲ ἐν ἑνί 1 but stumble in one thing James is using the adjective **one** as a noun to refer to one commandment of the law. (ULT adds the term **thing** to show this.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate the term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “but disobey one commandment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

JAS 2 11 ez11 figs-explicit ὁ…εἰπών 1 the one who said James is referring implicitly to God, who spoke the commandments quoted in this verse when he gave the law to Moses. Alternate translation: “God who said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 11 c8jm figs-youcrowd μὴ μοιχεύσῃς…μὴ φονεύσῃς…οὐ μοιχεύεις…φονεύεις…γέγονας 1 Do not commit adultery … Do not murder … you do not commit adultery … you do murder … you have become The implied “you” in the two commandments that James quotes in this verse is singular because, even though Moses gave these laws to the Israelites as a group, each individual person was expected to obey them. The word **you** is also singular in the rest of the verse because James is carrying forward that usage from the commandments. So in your translation, use the singular form of “you” if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
JAS 2 12 c6y8 figs-you οὕτως λαλεῖτε, καὶ οὕτως ποιεῖτε 1 Thus speak and thus act The implied “you” in these imperatives is plural. James returns here to the plural usage that he follows in most of his letter. So in your translation, use the plural form of “you” if your language marks that distinction and if it reflects it in imperatives. Alternate translation: “Speak and act in this way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
JAS 2 12 yp6i figs-activepassive μέλλοντες κρίνεσθαι 1 ones who are going to be judged If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “people whom God is going to judge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JAS 2 12 e87r figs-possession νόμου ἐλευθερίας 1 the law of freedom As in [1:25](../01/25.md), James is using the possessive form to describe a **law** that brings **freedom**. Alternate translation: “the law that brings freedom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JAS 2 12 j116 figs-abstractnouns νόμου ἐλευθερίας 1 the law of freedom If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind the abstract noun **freedom** with an adjective such as “free.” Alternate translation: “the law that sets people free” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 2 12 j117 figs-explicit νόμου ἐλευθερίας 1 the law of freedom If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly what the **law** gives people the **freedom** to do. Alternate translation: “the law that sets people free to obey God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 12 j118 figs-explicit νόμου ἐλευθερίας 1 the law of freedom In this context, it appears that when James speaks of **the law of freedom**, he is referring to the commandment that he quoted in [2:8](../02/08.md), “You will love your neighbor as yourself.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly and explain how this law sets people free. Alternate translation: “the law to love one’s neighbor, which sets people free to obey God by giving them a principle to follow in all of their actions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 13 j119 grammar-connect-logic-result γὰρ 1 For James is giving the reason why people should be guided in their actions by the principle of loving others, as he said in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “You should follow the principle of loving others because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JAS 2 13 j120 figs-metonymy ἡ γὰρ κρίσις ἀνέλεος τῷ μὴ ποιήσαντι ἔλεος 1 judgment is merciless to those who have not done mercy James is using the word **judgment** figuratively to represent God, the one who judges. Alternate translation: “when God judges people, he will not be merciful to people who have not shown mercy to others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 2 13 yv6l figs-personification ἡ γὰρ κρίσις ἀνέλεος τῷ μὴ ποιήσαντι ἔλεος 1 judgment is merciless to those who have not done mercy James is speaking figuratively of **judgment** as if it were a living thing that could act in a **merciless** way. Alternate translation: “When God judges people, he will not be merciful to people who have not shown mercy to others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JAS 2 13 j121  τῷ μὴ ποιήσαντι ἔλεος 1 to those who have not done mercy The word translated **mercy** can also refer to compassion. Since James is referring in this context to following the command to love others, that is likely what it means here. Alternate translation: “those who have not acted compassionately towards others”
JAS 2 13 j122 grammar-connect-logic-contrast κατακαυχᾶται ἔλεος κρίσεως 1 Mercy boasts against judgment There is an implied contrast between this sentence and the statement in the previous sentence that “judgment is merciless.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that contrast explicitly at the start of this sentence with a word such as “however.” Alternate translation: “However, mercy boasts against judgment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
JAS 2 13 j123 figs-personification κατακαυχᾶται ἔλεος κρίσεως 1 Mercy boasts against judgment James is speaking figuratively of **mercy** and **judgment** as if they were living things that could fight a contest against one another. He is also speaking figuratively of **mercy** as if it could boast after defeating **judgment** in such a contest. James is continuing to describe how God will judge people. Alternate translation: “However, God will show mercy when he judges people who have acted compassionately towards others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JAS 2 14 k4e4 figs-rquestion τί τὸ ὄφελος, ἀδελφοί μου, ἐὰν πίστιν λέγῃ τις, ἔχειν ἔργα, δὲ μὴ ἔχῃ? 1 What would be the profit, my brothers, if someone said he had faith, but he did not have works? James is using the question form as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “It does no good, my brothers, for someone to say he has faith if he does not have works.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JAS 2 14 j124 figs-idiom τί τὸ ὄφελος 1 What would be the profit This is an idiom. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use here. Alternate translation: “What good would it do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 2 14 j125 figs-metaphor ἀδελφοί μου 1 my brothers See how you translated the term **brothers** in [1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: “my fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 2 14 c234 figs-abstractnouns ἐὰν πίστιν λέγῃ τις, ἔχειν ἔργα, δὲ μὴ ἔχῃ 1 if someone said he had faith but he did not have works If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **faith** and **works** with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “if someone said he believed in God but he did not do what God wanted him to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 2 14 j126 figs-explicit μὴ δύναται ἡ πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόν 1 Faith is not able to save him, is it In context, James is clearly asking not about **faith** in general, but about faith that is not demonstrated in **works**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “That kind of faith is not able to save him, is it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 14 j127 figs-doublenegatives μὴ δύναται ἡ πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόν 1 Faith is not able to save him, is it The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding “is it?” Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Alternate translation: “Is that kind of faith able to save him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
JAS 2 14 z9q8 figs-rquestion μὴ δύναται ἡ πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόν? 1 Faith is not able to save him, is it? James is using the question form as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “That kind of faith is certainly not able to save him!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JAS 2 14 j128 figs-abstractnouns μὴ δύναται ἡ πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόν? 1 Faith is not able to save him, is it? If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract noun **faith** with a verb such as “believe.” Alternate translation: “Will merely believing in God save him?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 2 14 g8kr  σῶσαι αὐτόν 1 save him Your language may require you to specify what this kind of faith cannot **save** a person from. Alternate translation: “save him from God’s judgment”
JAS 2 15 j129 figs-hypo ἐὰν 1 If James is using a hypothetical situation to teach. He begins to describe the condition in this verse. He describes the rest of the condition and the result in the next verse. Alternate translation: “Suppose” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
JAS 2 15 f6el figs-metaphor ἀδελφὸς ἢ ἀδελφὴ 1 a brother or sister As everywhere else in the book, the term **brother** refers to a fellow believer. In every other instance, the term can mean either a man or a woman. But in this verse James uses **brother** to mean a believer who is a man and **sister** to mean a believer who is a woman. If your language has both masculine and the feminine forms of the word you have been using to translate “brother,” you can use them both here. Otherwise, you can use an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “another man or woman who believes in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 2 15 j130  γυμνοὶ 1 unclothed **Unclothed** can mean “naked,” and if a Bible translation already exists in your area, it may say that. But in this context, the word actually refers to lacking adequate clothes. Alternate translation: “badly clothed”
JAS 2 16 j131 figs-hypo δέ 1 and James is continuing to describe the condition of the hypothetical situation that he is using to teach. Alternate translation: “and suppose that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
JAS 2 16 j132 writing-pronouns αὐτοῖς…αὐτοῖς 1 to them … them Even though in the previous verse James spoke in the singular of “a brother or sister,” he now speaks of needy people generally in the plural, saying **them**. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could use the singular in this verse as well. Alternate translation: “to him or her … him or her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JAS 2 16 j133 figs-metonymy θερμαίνεσθε καὶ χορτάζεσθε 1 warm yourself and be satisfied The person who would say this to people in need would be speaking figuratively of clothing by association with the way its keeps people warm and figuratively of food by association with the way it satisfies people. Alternate translation: “have adequate clothing and enough food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 2 16 lj89  θερμαίνεσθε 1 warm yourself Alternate translation: “stay warm”
JAS 2 16 ngj8 figs-activepassive χορτάζεσθε 1 be satisfied If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an equivalent expression that uses an active verbal form. Alternate translation: “have enough food to satisfy you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JAS 2 16 j134 figs-hypo δὲ 1 but James is continuing to describe the hypothetical situation that he is using to teach. Alternate translation: “but also suppose that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
JAS 2 16 j135 writing-pronouns μὴ δῶτε 1 you do not give At the beginning of this verse, James speaks in the third-person singular of **one of you**. But he now speaks of believers generally in the second-person plural, saying **you**, to indicate how the community as a whole might respond to this situation. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could use the third-person singular here as well. Alternate translation: “he does not give” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JAS 2 16 j136 figs-nominaladj τὰ ἐπιτήδεια 1 the necessary things James is using the adjective **necessary** in the plural as a noun. (ULT adds **things** to show this.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate the term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the things that are necessary” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
JAS 2 16 n5jh figs-metonymy τοῦ σώματος 1 for the body James is speaking figuratively of meeting physical needs that also have an emotional and spiritual dimension by association with the way that these are needs of the human **body**. Alternate translation: “for people to be warm and well-fed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 2 16 yi63 figs-rquestion τί τὸ ὄφελος? 1 what would be the profit? James is using the question form as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:14](../02/14.md). Alternate translation: “that does no good!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JAS 2 16 j137 figs-hypo τί τὸ ὄφελος? 1 what would be the profit? This is the result of the hypothetical situation that James has been using to teach. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Then that does no good!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
JAS 2 17 me1d figs-personification ἡ πίστις, ἐὰν μὴ ἔχῃ ἔργα, νεκρά ἐστιν καθ’ ἑαυτήν 1 faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead James is speaking figuratively of **faith** as if it would be a living thing if it had works but not be alive if it did not have them. Alternate translation: “a person’s faith is not genuine by itself; he must express it through works” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JAS 2 17 j138 figs-abstractnouns ἡ πίστις, ἐὰν μὴ ἔχῃ ἔργα, νεκρά ἐστιν καθ’ ἑαυτήν 1 faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **faith** and **works** with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “if a person says he believes in God but he does not do what God wants him to do, then he does not really believe in God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 2 18 j139 figs-quotations ἀλλ’ ἐρεῖ τις, σὺ πίστιν ἔχεις, κἀγὼ ἔργα ἔχω 1 But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” See the discussion of this sentence in the General Notes to this chapter. It may be helpful to turn the direct quotation into an indirect quotation to make it clearer that the **you** who is being addressed is the same “one of you” as in [2:16](../02/16.md) and that when James says **I**, he is referring to himself. Alternate translation: “But someone may tell you that you have faith and I have works” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
JAS 2 18 j140 figs-explicit ἀλλ’ ἐρεῖ τις, σὺ πίστιν ἔχεις, κἀγὼ ἔργα ἔχω 1 But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” See the discussion of this sentence in the General Notes to this chapter. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate more explicitly what this statement means. (UST explains the implications even further than is suggested here.) Alternate translation: “But someone may try to reassure you that you nevertheless have faith, while I, James, have works” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 18 al63 figs-hypo ἀλλ’ ἐρεῖ τις 1 But someone will say James is using a hypothetical situation to teach. This expression introduces the condition of the hypothetical situation. (As Part 1 of the General Introduction to James explains, in the style of speakers of this time, James is anticipating an objection that someone might make and saying how he would respond to it.) Alternate translation: “But suppose someone said to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
JAS 2 18 j141 figs-yousingular σὺ πίστιν ἔχεις 1 you have faith Here, **you** is singular because James is illustrating how someone might address one individual. James himself then addresses that same individual in the rest of this verse and in verses [19-22](../02/19.md). So if your language marks the distinction, use the singular form of “you” in your translation from here through verse 22. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
JAS 2 18 j142 figs-quotations δεῖξόν μοι τὴν πίστιν σου χωρὶς τῶν ἔργων, κἀγώ σοι δείξω ἐκ τῶν ἔργων μου τὴν πίστιν 1 Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith from works It may be helpful to make this sentence a direct quotation after an introduction to show that it is what James would say in response to the hypothetical objection. Alternate translation: “Then I would say to you, ‘Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith from works’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
JAS 2 18 j143 figs-hypo δεῖξόν μοι τὴν πίστιν σου χωρὶς τῶν ἔργων, κἀγώ σοι δείξω ἐκ τῶν ἔργων μου τὴν πίστιν 1 Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith from works This is the result of the hypothetical situation that James has been describing. Alternate translation: “Then I would say to you, ‘Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith from works’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
JAS 2 18 j144 figs-imperative δεῖξόν μοι τὴν πίστιν σου χωρὶς τῶν ἔργων 1 Show me your faith without works James is using the imperative **show me** to challenge the hypothetical “you” and make him realize that he really cannot do what James is telling him to do. Alternate translation: “You cannot show me your faith without works” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
JAS 2 18 ii8d figs-abstractnouns δεῖξόν μοι τὴν πίστιν σου χωρὶς τῶν ἔργων 1 Show me your faith without works If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **faith** and **works** with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “You cannot show me that you truly believe in God if you are not doing what God wants you to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 2 18 j145 figs-declarative κἀγώ σοι δείξω ἐκ τῶν ἔργων μου τὴν πίστιν 1 and I will show you my faith from works James is using a future statement to indicate something he is capable of doing. Alternate translation: “but I can show you my faith from works” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])

Alternate translation: “but by doing what God wants me to do, I can show you that I truly believe in God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 2 19 j147  σὺ πιστεύεις ὅτι εἷς ἐστιν ὁ Θεός 1 You believe that God is one The verb translated **believe** comes from the same root as the word translated “faith.” It may be helpful to show that in your translation to make it clearer that James is continuing to speak to the same person as in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “You have faith that God is one”
JAS 2 19 j148  σὺ πιστεύεις ὅτι εἷς ἐστιν ὁ Θεός 1 You believe that God is one As Part 1 of the General Introduction to James explains, the people to whom James was writing were believers in Jesus who had a Jewish background. As a result, they would have known that he was referring here to the essential Jewish affirmation, “Listen, Israel, Yahweh our God is one.” Moses says this in [Deuteronomy 6:4](../deu/06/04.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “You believe the essential teaching of Moses that there is one God”
JAS 2 19 j149 figs-irony καλῶς ποιεῖς; καὶ τὰ δαιμόνια πιστεύουσιν καὶ φρίσσουσιν 1 You do well. The demons also believe, and they tremble When James says **you do well**, he is saying the opposite of what he really means. He grants that believing in one God is a good thing in itself, but he is actually saying that by itself, it is the kind of faith without works that cannot save a person. He proves this by observing that the demons, who are not saved, also believe that there is one God, and this makes them tremble. Alternate translation: “You may think that is a good thing to do. But the demons also believe in one God, and they tremble” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
JAS 2 19 fv39 figs-explicit καὶ τὰ δαιμόνια πιστεύουσιν καὶ φρίσσουσιν 1 The demons also believe, and they tremble If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly why the demons **tremble** at the thought of God. Alternate translation: “The demons also believe in one God, and they tremble, knowing that God is going to punish them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 20 ax95 figs-rquestion θέλεις δὲ γνῶναι, ὦ ἄνθρωπε κενέ, ὅτι ἡ πίστις χωρὶς τῶν ἔργων ἀργή ἐστιν? 1 But do you wish to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is idle? James is using the question form as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “But I can show you, O foolish man, that faith without works is idle.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JAS 2 20 j150 figs-idiom θέλεις…γνῶναι 1 do you wish to know This is an idiom. It means “I can show you” by suggesting implicitly, “If you really want to know, I can show you.” Alternate translation as a statement: “I can show you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 2 20 j151  ὦ ἄνθρωπε κενέ 1 O foolish man James is addressing this hypothetical **man** in the vocative after an exclamation. If your language has a vocative case, it would be appropriate to use it here. If not, you could express the meaning in another way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you foolish man”
JAS 2 20 j152 figs-gendernotations ὦ ἄνθρωπε κενέ 1 O foolish man James is using the term **man** in a generic sense that could mean any person, male or female. Alternate translation: “you foolish person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
JAS 2 20 j153 figs-personification ἡ πίστις χωρὶς τῶν ἔργων ἀργή ἐστιν 1 faith without works is idle James is speaking figuratively of **faith** as if it were a living thing that would be lazily doing nothing if it did not have works. Alternate translation: “a person’s faith is useless if he does not express it through works” or “a person’s faith is unproductive if he does not express it through works” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JAS 2 20 sd63 figs-abstractnouns ἡ πίστις χωρὶς τῶν ἔργων ἀργή ἐστιν 1 faith without works is idle If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **faith** and **works** with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “it is useless for a person to say that he believes in God if he does not do what God wants him to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 2 20 j154 translate-textvariants ἡ πίστις χωρὶς τῶν ἔργων ἀργή ἐστιν 1 faith without works is idle See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to use this reading in your translation or a different reading, “faith without works is dead.” The note below discusses a translation issue in that reading, for those who decide to use it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
JAS 2 20 j155 figs-personification ἡ πίστις χωρὶς τῶν ἔργων ἀργή ἐστιν 1 faith without works is idle If the reading “faith without works is dead” is accurate, then James is speaking figuratively of **faith** as if it would be alive if it had works but it would not be alive if it did not have them. Alternate translation: “a person’s faith is not genuine if he does not express it through works” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JAS 2 21 q8iv figs-rquestion Ἀβραὰμ ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη, ἀνενέγκας Ἰσαὰκ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον? 1 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? James is using the question form as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Abraham our father was justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JAS 2 21 j156 figs-explicit Ἀβραὰμ ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη, ἀνενέγκας Ἰσαὰκ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον? 1 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? James assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to a story recorded in the book of Genesis. In that story, God tells Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice, but God does not really want Abraham to do that. Rather, God wants Abraham to demonstrate his faith and obedience by showing that he is willing to do it. God ultimately stops Abraham from sacrificing his son Isaac. You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story and if they would think that Abraham actually did offer his son as a sacrifice. Alternate translation, as a statement: “Abraham our father was justified by works when he demonstrated that he was willing to obey God even if that meant offering his son Isaac as a sacrifice, although God did not actually want him to do that and God stopped him from doing it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 21 v3ft figs-explicit Ἀβραὰμ ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη 1 Was not Abraham our father justified by works See the discussion in Part 2 of the General Introduction to James about how a person is justified before God. James is not saying that Abraham did something that made God consider him righteous. Rather, as James will explain in more detail in the next two verses, God had previously declared Abraham to be righteous because Abraham believed in him. What Abraham did subsequently, when he proved that he was willing to obey God, demonstrated that his faith was genuine. You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they might misunderstand and think that Abraham did something that made God consider him righteous. Alternate translation, as a statement: “God declared Abraham our father to be righteous because what he did demonstrated that he genuinely believed in God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 21 j157 figs-activepassive Ἀβραὰμ ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν οὐκ…ἐδικαιώθη 1 Was not Abraham our father justified If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation, as a statement: “God justified Abraham our father” or “God declared Abraham our father to be righteous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

James assumes that his readers will know that it refers to how Abraham responded to God’s promise that even though he and his wife were old and had no children, he would have as many descendants as the stars in the sky. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could give an explicit indication of this. Alternate translation: “Abraham believed God’s promise that he would have many descendants, and so God considered Abraham to be in a right relationship with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 2 23 j163 figs-explicit φίλος Θεοῦ ἐκλήθη 1 he was called a friend of God James assumes that his readers will know that in [Isaiah 41:8](../isa/41/08.md), God refers to the Israelites as “the offspring of Abraham my friend” and that in [2 Chronicles 20:7](../2ch/20/07.md), in a prayer to God, King Jehoshaphat refers to the Israelites as “the descendants of Abraham your friend.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could give an explicit indication of this.

JAS 2 24 j169 figs-explicit ἐξ ἔργων…καὶ οὐκ ἐκ πίστεως μόνον 1 from works and not from faith alone See the discussion in Part 2 of the General Introduction to James about how a person is justified before God. James is not saying that we need to add works to our faith in order to be justified. Rather, James is speaking of works that are an expression and proof of the saving faith that a person already has. You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they might misunderstand and think that James is saying that we have to add works to our faith in order for God to consider us righteous. Alternate translation: “by what he does as an expression of what he believes, and not just by what he believes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Rahab provided safety and shelter for these spies in her home, and she then sent them away safely by a route that their pursuers would not have expected them to take. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could give an explicit indication of this. Alternate translation: “when she provided shelter and safety in her home for the spies whom Joshua sent to explore the land of Canaan and when she sent these spies safely away by a route that their pursuers would not have expected them to take” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

JAS 2 26 j172 grammar-connect-logic-result γὰρ 1 For James is using this word to introduce a general principle that can be deduced from the argument he has been making since [2:14](../02/14.md) that **faith** needs to be expressed in **works**. He does not say **For**, which often means “because,” to indicate that God justified Abraham and Rahab for this reason. Rather, he is using the word **For** in order to bring his argument to its conclusion. Alternate translation: “These specific cases confirm the general principle that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JAS 2 26 j173  τὸ σῶμα χωρὶς πνεύματος νεκρόν ἐστιν 1 the body without the spirit is dead The word translated **spirit** can also mean “breath.” Alternate translation: “a body that does not have the breath of life in it is dead”

JAS 3 1 aw5f figs-explicit μεῖζον κρίμα λημψόμεθα 1 we will receive greater judgment By **greater judgment**, James means that God will judge people who teach his word more strictly than he will judge other people. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly why that is true. Alternate translation: “God will judge us who teach his word more strictly than he will judge other people, because our teaching greatly influences what other people believe and how they live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 3 2 j176 grammar-connect-logic-result γὰρ 1 For James is using **For** to introduce the reason why most of his readers should not become teachers, not the reason why God will judge teachers more strictly.

JAS 4 1 v5kg figs-metaphor τῶν ἡδονῶν ὑμῶν, τῶν στρατευομένων ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν ὑμῶν 1 your lusts, which fight in your members As in [3:6](../03/06.md), **members** means “parts of the body.” This could mean: (1) the phrase **in your members** indicates the location of the **lusts** that James is describing. He could be saying that the outward fights between members of the community have their origin in inward lusts that lead people to fight for what they want, as he describes in the next verse. If so, he is using the parts of the body figuratively to represent a person’s thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “the lusts inside of you that fight” (2) the word translated **in** means “among.” The sense would then be that these **lusts** fight against one part of the person after another, seeking to gain control of the whole person. Since the **lusts** would actually be gaining control over non-physical aspects of a person, such as his will and values, James would once again be using the physical parts of the body figuratively to express his meaning. Alternate translation: “your lusts, which fight to control you” (3) James is speaking figuratively of the community of believers as if it were a body and of individual believers as if they were parts of that body. Alternate translation: “your lusts, which fight against other believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 4 1 vpe2 figs-personification τῶν ἡδονῶν ὑμῶν, τῶν στρατευομένων ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν ὑμῶν 1 your lusts, which fight in your members In all of the cases that the previous note discusses, James would be speaking figuratively of **lusts** as if they were living things that could **fight.** Alternate translation: “the lusts inside of you that cause you to fight to get what you want” of “your lusts, which cause you to value and choose certain things in order to gratify them” or “your lusts, which cause you to fight against other believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

You kill and envy, and you are not able to obtain In both of these sentences, James is using the word translated **and** to introduce a contrast between the first and second clauses. Alternate translation: “You covet, but you do not have. You kill and envy, but you are not able to obtain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
JAS 4 2 j244  ἐπιθυμεῖτε καὶ οὐκ ἔχετε; φονεύετε καὶ ζηλοῦτε, καὶ οὐ δύνασθε ἐπιτυχεῖν 1 You covet, and you do not have. You kill and envy, and you are not able to obtain Your language may require you to specify the objects of **have** and **obtain**. Alternate translation: “You covet, but you do not have what you covet. You kill and envy, but you are not able to obtain the things that you envy”
JAS 4 2 j245 figs-parallelism ἐπιθυμεῖτε καὶ οὐκ ἔχετε; φονεύετε καὶ ζηλοῦτε, καὶ οὐ δύνασθε ἐπιτυχεῖν 1 You covet, and you do not have. You kill and envy, and you are not able to obtain These two sentences mean similar things. James is using them together for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “You desperately want things that other people have, but you cannot get them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
JAS 4 2 khh9 figs-metaphor φονεύετε καὶ ζηλοῦτε 1 You kill and envy James probably does not mean the word **kill** literally. Rather, this could mean: (1) James is using the word in a figurative and spiritual sense to mean “hate.” This usage would reflect the teaching of Jesus and the apostles. Jesus said that the meaning of the commandment “do not kill” also applied to being angry with others and insulting them ([Matthew 5:21-22](../mat/05/21.md)). The apostle John wrote that “everyone who hates his brother is a murderer” ([1 John 3:15](../1jn/03/15.md)). Alternate translation: “You hate and envy” (2) James is describing someone wanting something so badly that he would almost kill to get it. Alternate translation: “You envy almost to the point of murder” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 4 2 j246 figs-hendiadys φονεύετε καὶ ζηλοῦτε 1 You kill and envy James is expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The word **kill** describes how his readers **envy** what others have.

JAS 4 2 j247 figs-metaphor μάχεσθε καὶ πολεμεῖτε 1 You battle and war As in [4:1](../04/01.md), James is using the terms **battle** and **war** figuratively. Alternate translation: “You engage in disputes and conflicts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 4 2 v9m8 figs-doublet μάχεσθε καὶ πολεμεῖτε 1 You battle and war The words **battle** and **war** mean similar things. James is using them together for emphasis.

JAS 4 2 j248 figs-explicit οὐκ ἔχετε, διὰ τὸ μὴ αἰτεῖσθαι ὑμᾶς 1 You do not have because you do not ask If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say more fully what this means.

JAS 4 3 j250 figs-metaphor ἵνα ἐν ταῖς ἡδοναῖς ὑμῶν δαπανήσητε 1 so that you may spend on your lusts James says figuratively that his readers would **spend** what they acquired on their lusts. Alternate translation: “so that you can gratify your sinful desires” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 4 4 j251  μοιχαλίδες 1 Adulteresses James is addressing his readers in the vocative. If your language has a vocative case, it would be appropriate to use it here. If not, you could express the meaning in another way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You adulteresses”
JAS 4 4 efi8 figs-metaphor μοιχαλίδες 1 Adulteresses James is figuratively describing his readers as married women who have sexual relations with men who are not their husbands. This metaphor is used many places in the Bible to represent unfaithfulness to God. Alternate translation: “You are not being faithful to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 4 4 wu5v figs-rquestion οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι ἡ φιλία τοῦ κόσμου, ἔχθρα τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστιν? 1 Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? James is using the question form for emphasis and as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Certainly you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JAS 4 4 j252 figs-abstractnouns ἡ φιλία τοῦ κόσμου, ἔχθρα τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστιν 1 friendship with the world is enmity with God If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **friendship** and **enmity** with the concrete nouns “friend” and “enemy.” Alternate translation: “if you are a friend of the world, you are an enemy of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 4 4 b5ly figs-metonymy ἡ φιλία τοῦ κόσμου 1 friendship with the world As in [1:27](../01/27.md), James is using the term **world** figuratively to mean the system of values shared by people who do not honor God. Alternate translation: “friendship with an ungodly value system” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 4 4 br36 figs-personification ἡ φιλία τοῦ κόσμου 1 friendship with the world James is speaking figuratively of this ungodly value system as if it were a person with whom someone could be friends. Alternate translation: “living by an ungodly value system” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JAS 4 4 jf1g figs-metaphor ἔχθρα τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστιν 1 is enmity with God James probably does not consider that his readers have literally become sworn enemies of God. He is using the term **enmity** figuratively to describe how opposed the worldly value system is to the way God wants people to live. Alternate translation: “is contrary to what God wants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 4 4 j253 figs-metonymy φίλος εἶναι τοῦ κόσμου 1 to be a friend of the world See how you translated the term **world** earlier in this verse. Alternate translation: “to be a friend of an ungodly value system” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

JAS 4 5 i2y4 figs-rquestion ἢ δοκεῖτε ὅτι κενῶς ἡ Γραφὴ λέγει 1 Or do you think that the Scripture says vainly James is using the question form as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. (In this context, the term **vainly** means “for no good reason,” not “in a conceited way.”) Alternate translation: “There is a good reason why the Scripture says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JAS 4 5 j257  ἡ Γραφὴ λέγει 1 the Scripture says James is describing the general teaching of the Bible, not referring to a specific passage. In cases like this, your language might use the plural instead of the singular. Alternate translation: “the Scriptures say”
JAS 4 5 j258 figs-personification ἡ Γραφὴ λέγει 1 the Scripture says James is speaking figuratively of the Bible as if it could speak on its own. Alternate translation: “it is written in the Scriptures” or “we can read in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JAS 4 5 bx68  πρὸς φθόνον ἐπιποθεῖ τὸ Πνεῦμα ὃ κατῴκισεν ἐν ἡμῖν 1 The Spirit whom he caused to live in us longs with jealousy Here, **Spirit** could mean: (1) the Holy Spirit, who could be the subject of the verb **longs**. The idea of the Spirit being jealous would fit with the adultery metaphor in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “The Spirit whom God has caused to live in us longs for us to live faithfully to God” (2) the Holy Spirit, who could be the object of the verb **longs**, in which case God would be the subject of that verb. This interpretation would also fit with the adultery metaphor. Alternate translation: “God longs jealously for us to live by the Spirit whom he has caused to live in us” (3) the human spirit, in which case the statement would be repeating what James said in [4:2](../04/02.md) about people coveting and envying. Alternate translation: “The spirit that God has caused to live in us longs jealously for things that it does not have”
JAS 4 5 j259 writing-pronouns ὃ κατῴκισεν ἐν ἡμῖν 1 whom he caused to live in us Whatever the interpretation of the entire sentence, the pronoun **he** in this clause refers to God. Alternate translation: “whom God caused to live in us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JAS 4 6 ub8z figs-explicit μείζονα δὲ δίδωσιν χάριν 1 But he gives greater grace In light of what he says in the previous two verses, James is drawing a contrast between what God might be expected to do and what God actually does. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the contrast more explicitly. Alternate translation: “But even though God is jealous if we are friends with the world, he does not reject us. Instead, he gives us even more grace to be friends with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Even though James is now quoting a specific passage, [Proverbs 3:34](../pro/03/34.md), rather than a general teaching, the reference is to the Bible as a whole. Alternate translation: “Therefore the Scripture says” or “Therefore the Scriptures say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JAS 4 6 j262 figs-personification λέγει 1 it says James is speaking figuratively of the Bible as if it could speak on its own. Alternate translation: “it is written in the Scriptures” or “we can read in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

JAS 4 8 j265 figs-metaphor καθαρίσατε χεῖρας 1 Cleanse your hands James is using the image of washing hands to describe a person removing sin from his life. Alternate translation: “Stop sinning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

JAS 4 10 an8i figs-metaphor ἐνώπιον Κυρίου 1 before the Lord The word **before** means “in front of” or “in the presence of” another person.

That is, he means the commandment “you will love your neighbor as yourself.” James is teaching his readers that by saying or assuming that their fellow believers were doing wrong things, they were not following this commandment and they were treating the commandment as if it were not important to follow. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. See how you translated the term “neighbor” in [2:8](../02/08.md). Alternate translation: “contradicts the law that says to love other people as oneself and judges that law to be unimportant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 4 11 j278 figs-youcrowd εἰ…νόμον κρίνεις, οὐκ εἶ ποιητὴς νόμου 1 if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law The word **you** is singular in these two cases because even though James is addressing a group of people, he is describing an individual situation.

JAS 4 11 jlx4 figs-explicit οὐκ εἶ ποιητὴς νόμου, ἀλλὰ κριτής 1 you are not a doer of the law, but a judge If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say more explicitly what this means.

JAS 4 12 m49q figs-rquestion σὺ δὲ τίς εἶ, ὁ κρίνων τὸν πλησίον? 1 But who are you, the one judging a neighbor? James is using the question form to challenge and teach his readers.

JAS 4 12 j281 writing-pronouns σὺ δὲ τίς εἶ 1 But who are you For emphasis, James includes the pronoun **you** even though it is not required with the verb. If your language does not ordinarily require pronouns with verbs but it can include them for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may be able to convey this emphasis in other ways, such as by repeating the pronoun. Alternate translation: “But you, who are you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JAS 4 12 j282 figs-youcrowd σὺ…τίς εἶ 1 who are you As in the previous verse, James is using the singular form of **you** because even though he is addressing a group of people, he is describing an individual situation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])

JAS 4 13 j285  οἱ λέγοντες 1 the ones saying James is addressing his readers in the vocative. If your language has a vocative case, it would be appropriate to use it here. If not, you could express the meaning in another way that would be natural in your language. (If you use the word “you,” it would be plural, since James is addressing a group of people.) Alternate translation: “you who say”
JAS 4 13 j286 figs-exclusive πορευσόμεθα 1 we will travel These people are speaking only of themselves, so the pronoun **we** is exclusive here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

James is using the question form to challenge and teach his readers. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You do not know what will happen tomorrow, and you may not even be alive then!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JAS 4 14 a9v2 figs-metaphor ἀτμὶς γάρ ἐστε, ἡ πρὸς ὀλίγον φαινομένη, ἔπειτα καὶ ἀφανιζομένη 1 For you are a mist that appears for a little and then disappears James is speaking figuratively of his readers as if they were a **mist** that forms briefly in the morning but then quickly dissipates when the sun rises. In your translation you could explain the meaning of this image, or you could represent it as a simile, as UST does. Alternate translation: “For you will only be alive for a short time, and then you will die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 4 15 e1il  καὶ ζήσομεν καὶ ποιήσομεν 1 we will both live and do James is using a construction that puts the word “and” before two things that would both be the case, more literally “and we will live and we will do.” Your language may have a similar construction that you can use here. If not, it may not be necessary for you to translate the first occurrence of “and,” which ULT represents as **both**. (The term **both** in ULT does not mean “the two of us.”) Alternate translation: “we will live and we will do”
JAS 4 15 j289 figs-exclusive καὶ ζήσομεν καὶ ποιήσομεν 1 we will both live and do These people would be speaking only of themselves, so the pronoun **we** is exclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
JAS 4 15 j290 figs-idiom τοῦτο ἢ ἐκεῖνο 1 this or that This is an idiom. No specific actions are intended. Your language may have a comparable idiom that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “such-and-such” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 4 16 j291 figs-abstractnouns καυχᾶσθε ἐν ταῖς ἀλαζονίαις ὑμῶν. πᾶσα καύχησις τοιαύτη πονηρά ἐστιν 1 you are boasting in your pretensions. All such boasting is evil If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **pretensions** and **boasting** (the second occurrence of the word in ULT) with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “you are boasting about what you presume you will be able to do. It is always wrong to boast like that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 4 17 q84z  εἰδότι οὖν καλὸν ποιεῖν, καὶ μὴ ποιοῦντι, ἁμαρτία αὐτῷ ἐστιν 1 Therefore to the one having known to do good and not doing it, to him it is sin James is using the word **therefore** to describe a further inference rather than a conclusion. He is saying that if it is wrong to plan to do things without knowing whether God wants you to do them, then it is also wrong not to do things that you do know God wants. Alternate translation: “From this we can also recognize that if someone does know what God wants him to do but he does not do it, then he is also sinning”

Waiting patiently for the Lord’s return (5:7-11)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;3. Oaths forbidden (5:12)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;4. Prayer, forgiveness, and healing (5:13-18)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;5.

The second section of the chapter is related to that first section. In it, James stresses that it is important to live with the expectation that Jesus will return soon. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Oaths&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [5:12](../05/12.md), James tells his readers not to swear any oaths. However, biblical scholars are divided over whether James intends to teach literally that all oaths are wrong. Some scholars believe that some oaths are permissible and that James is emphasizing how Christians should have integrity in what they say.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Elijah&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The illustration that James gives from the life of the prophet Elijah in [5:17-18](../05/17.md) may be difficult for your readers to appreciate if the books of 1 and 2 Kings have not yet been translated. See the first note to 5:17 for a suggestion about how to help your readers understand this illustration better.
JAS 5 1 j292 figs-idiom ἄγε νῦν 1 Come now This is an idiom. See how you translated it in [4:13](../04/13.md). Alternate translation: “Now listen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 5 1 j293  οἱ πλούσιοι 1 the rich James is addressing these people in the vocative. If your language has a vocative case, it would be appropriate to use it here. If not, you could express the meaning in another way that would be natural in your language. (If you use the word “you,” it would be plural, since James is addressing a group of people.) Alternate translation: “you who are rich”
JAS 5 1 j294 figs-nominaladj οἱ πλούσιοι 1 the rich James is using the adjective **rich** as a noun to refer to a type of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “you people who are rich” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
JAS 5 1 gel9 figs-explicit οἱ πλούσιοι 1 the rich James is most likely addressing believers who are rich, or at least rich people who were attending assemblies of believers, rather than unbelievers who are rich or rich people in general. (This letter was meant to be read aloud in those assemblies, and James notes in [1:10](../01/10.md) that some of the believers were rich.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “you believers who are rich” or “you rich people who say you want to follow Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 5 1 j295  ἐπὶ ταῖς ταλαιπωρίαις ὑμῶν ταῖς ἐπερχομέναις 1 because of your coming miseries Your language may similarly speak of something that is going to happen in the future as if it were **coming**. If it does not, you can express this in another way. Alternate translation: “because of the miseries you will soon experience”
JAS 5 1 l3wd figs-abstractnouns ἐπὶ ταῖς ταλαιπωρίαις ὑμῶν ταῖς ἐπερχομέναις 1 because of your coming miseries If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **miseries** with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “because many bad things are going to happen to you soon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JAS 5 2 j296 translate-versebridge  0  If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [5:2](../05/02.md) and [5:3](../05/03.md) into a verse bridge. You could put the last sentence of [5:3](../05/03.md) first, followed by all of [5:2](../05/02.md) and then the rest of [5:3](../05/03.md). This would allow you to address several translation issues that are discussed in the notes to this verse and the next verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
JAS 5 2 gq45 figs-pastforfuture ὁ πλοῦτος ὑμῶν σέσηπεν, καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια ὑμῶν σητόβρωτα γέγονεν 1 Your wealth has rotted and your clothes have become moth-eaten James is using the past tense to refer to things that will happen in the future. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “Your wealth is going to rot and your clothes are going to be eaten by moths” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
JAS 5 2 v241 figs-synecdoche ὁ πλοῦτος ὑμῶν σέσηπεν, καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια ὑμῶν σητόβρωτα γέγονεν 1 Your wealth has rotted and your clothes have become moth-eaten In these two clauses and in the first clause in the next verse (“your gold and silver have been tarnished”), James is figuratively using certain things that these rich people own to mean everything that they own. If you create a verse bridge, you can combine all of these clauses into a single sentence that expresses this meaning. (You would need to begin a new sentence right afterwards.) Alternate translation: “Everything of value that you own is going to be ruined” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
JAS 5 2 j297 figs-explicit ὁ πλοῦτος ὑμῶν σέσηπεν, καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια ὑμῶν σητόβρωτα γέγονεν 1 Your wealth has rotted and your clothes have become moth-eaten Depending on the meaning of the statement “you have stored up in the last days” in the next verse (see the note to that statement), James may be saying figuratively that the wealth and expensive clothing of the rich have become worthless. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 5 2 j298 figs-simile ὁ πλοῦτος ὑμῶν σέσηπεν, καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια ὑμῶν σητόβρωτα γέγονεν 1 Your wealth has rotted and your clothes have become moth-eaten If you decide to indicate explicitly that James is saying that the wealth and expensive clothing of the rich have become worthless, you could do that by expressing his past-for-future statement as a simile, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
JAS 5 3 am1u figs-pastforfuture ὁ χρυσὸς ὑμῶν καὶ ὁ ἄργυρος κατίωται 1 Your gold and silver have been tarnished James is using the past tense to refer to something that will happen in the future. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “Your gold and silver are going to be tarnished” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
JAS 5 3 wj9v figs-activepassive ὁ χρυσὸς ὑμῶν καὶ ὁ ἄργυρος κατίωται 1 Your gold and silver have been tarnished If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Your gold and silver have tarnished” or “Your gold and silver are going to tarnish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JAS 5 3 j299 figs-explicit ὁ χρυσὸς ὑμῶν καὶ ὁ ἄργυρος κατίωται 1 Your gold and silver have been tarnished Depending on the meaning of the statement “you have stored up in the last days” (see the first note to that statement below), James may be saying figuratively that the gold and silver of the rich have become worthless. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 5 3 q4pm figs-simile ὁ χρυσὸς ὑμῶν καὶ ὁ ἄργυρος κατίωται 1 Your gold and silver have been tarnished If you decide to indicate explicitly that James is saying that the gold and silver of the rich have become worthless, you could do that by expressing his past-for-future statement as a simile, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
JAS 5 3 j300  καὶ ὁ ἰὸς αὐτῶν εἰς μαρτύριον ὑμῖν ἔσται 1 and their rust will be for a testimony against you If you created a verse bridge and you also combined the statement “your gold and silver have been tarnished” with the two clauses in [5:2](../05/02.md), it would be helpful to begin a new sentence here and to use a general expression that would apply to everything that these rich people own. Alternate translation: “The ruins of your possessions will be for a testimony against you” or “The ruins of your possessions will testify against you”
JAS 5 3 e55t figs-metaphor ὁ ἰὸς αὐτῶν εἰς μαρτύριον ὑμῖν ἔσται 1 their rust will be for a testimony against you James is speaking figuratively of this **rust** as if it would be presented as evidence in a case against the rich people. Alternate translation: “the rust on your gold and silver will show that you did the wrong thing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 3 j301 figs-explicit ὁ ἰὸς αὐτῶν εἰς μαρτύριον ὑμῖν ἔσται 1 their rust will be for a testimony against you If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly what wrong thing these rich people have done, as evidenced by this **rust**. Alternate translation: “the rust of your gold and silver will show that you have done the wrong thing by devoting yourselves to accumulating wealth rather than to helping other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 5 3 w3aj figs-metonymy φάγεται τὰς σάρκας ὑμῶν ὡς πῦρ 1 it will eat your flesh James is using the word **flesh** to mean the human body, by association with the way the body is made of flesh. Alternate translation: “it will eat your bodies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 5 3 j6fe figs-metaphor φάγεται τὰς σάρκας ὑμῶν ὡς πῦρ 1 it will eat your flesh James is saying figuratively that this rust will corrode and consume the owners of the gold and silver that it is also corroding. Alternate translation: “it will consume you” or “it will ruin you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 3 i37x figs-simile ὡς πῦρ 1 like fire It may be helpful to express the meaning of this simile more fully. Alternate translation: “just as fire consumes everything that it burns” or “just as fire ruins everything that it burns” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
JAS 5 3 j302 figs-explicit ἐθησαυρίσατε ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις 1 You have stored up in the last days If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly what these rich people have **stored up** and why it was wrong for them to do that. This could mean: (1) they have accumulated riches in the **last days**, that is, in the time just before Jesus returns. That would be wrong because once Jesus returns, earthly riches will no longer have any value. Instead of trying to get more and more wealth, these people should have been helping others with what they had. Alternate translation: “Instead of helping others, you have wrongly stored up wealth at a time when earthly riches are about to lose all of their value” (2) by their wrongdoing, such as he describes in [5:4-6](../05/04.md), these rich people have **stored up** punishment for themselves. Alternate translation: “God is just about to punish wrongdoers, and you have given God many reasons to punish you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 5 3 j303 grammar-connect-logic-result ἐθησαυρίσατε ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις 1 You have stored up in the last days If the first interpretation of this statement in the note just above is correct, then James is giving the reason for the results that he describes in the previous verse and in the earlier part of this verse. If you created a verse bridge as described in the first note to [5:2](../05/02.md), you could put this reason before the result by placing this statement first in that bridge. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JAS 5 3 np1u figs-idiom ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις 1 the last days This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “the time just before Jesus returns” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 5 4 j304 figs-metaphor ἰδοὺ, ὁ μισθὸς τῶν ἐργατῶν 1 Behold, the pay of the workers The term **Behold** focuses the attention of a listener or reader on what a speaker or writer is about to say. It may be helpful to express its meaning as a separate sentence here. Alternate translation: “Consider this! The pay of the workers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 4 j305 figs-activepassive ὁ μισθὸς τῶν ἐργατῶν, τῶν ἀμησάντων τὰς χώρας ὑμῶν, ὁ ἀφυστερημένος ἀφ’ ὑμῶν, κράζει 1 the pay of the workers who have reaped your fields, which has been withheld from you, is crying out If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. When James says **from you**, he does not mean that this payment has been withheld from the rich owners of these fields. He is saying that it was due from them, but they have not paid it to their workers. Alternate translation: “the pay that you have withheld from the workers who reaped your fields is crying out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JAS 5 4 e9iy figs-personification κράζει 1 is crying out James is speaking figuratively of this **pay** as if it were a living thing that could cry out. Alternate translation: “is obvious evidence that you have done wrong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JAS 5 4 n21a figs-metonymy αἱ βοαὶ τῶν θερισάντων, εἰς τὰ ὦτα Κυρίου Σαβαὼθ εἰσελήλυθαν 1 the cries of the harvesting ones have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth James is speaking figuratively of the **ears** of the Lord to mean his hearing. Alternate translation: “the Lord of Sabaoth has heard the cries of the harvesting ones” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 5 4 j306 figs-explicit Κυρίου Σαβαὼθ 1 the Lord of Sabaoth James assumes that his readers will know that he is speaking of God by a name by which he is often known in the Old Testament. The Hebrew term **Sabaoth** means “military forces.” Alternate translation: “God, the Lord of the Heavenly Armies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 5 4 j307 figs-metonymy Κυρίου Σαβαὼθ 1 the Lord of Sabaoth James may be speaking figuratively of God’s almighty power by association with the way that God has all the armies of heaven at his command. Alternate translation: “God, the Lord Almighty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JAS 5 5 j308 figs-parallelism ἐτρυφήσατε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. καὶ ἐσπαταλήσατε 1 You have lived luxuriously on the earth and have lived self-indulgently These two phrases mean similar things. James is using them together for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “You have indulged yourselves with earthly luxuries” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
JAS 5 5 xt8h figs-metaphor ἐθρέψατε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σφαγῆς 1 You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter James is speaking figuratively of these rich people as if they were cattle that had been fed luxuriously on grain so they would become fattened for slaughter as banqueting food. In this case the banquet is not a positive image, as it often is elsewhere when it describes God’s future reign. Alternate translation: “Your self-indulgence has made you subject to harsh judgment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 5 pr31 figs-metaphor ἐθρέψατε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σφαγῆς 1 You have fattened your hearts James is speaking figuratively of the heart as the center of human desire. Alternate translation: “You have indulged your desires” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 5 j309 figs-idiom ἐν ἡμέρᾳ 1 in a day James is using the term **day** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “at a time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JAS 5 5 j310 figs-metaphor ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σφαγῆς 1 in a day of slaughter James is using the idea of **slaughter** figuratively to refer to God’s judgment. Alternate translation: “at a time when God is about to judge everyone for what they have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 6 u5c5 figs-synecdoche κατεδικάσατε, ἐφονεύσατε τὸν δίκαιον 1 You have condemned, you have killed the righteous James probably does not mean that these rich people have done these things personally. He is likely referring to the kind of actions he described in [2:6](../02/06.md), where he told how rich people “overpower” the poor by taking them to court. He may mean that the rich people have gotten the courts to condemn innocent people and in some cases even to execute them. He could also mean that the rich people have gotten the courts to decide lawsuits in their favor and that as a result, some poor people have died because of the great poverty this caused them. James would be speaking figuratively of the rich people as the ones who did these actions, using them to represent all the people who were involved. Alternate translation: “You have gotten the courts to condemn and even execute innocent people” or “You have gotten the courts to decide lawsuits in your favor and, as a result, innocent people have died from poverty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
JAS 5 6 j311 figs-nominaladj τὸν δίκαιον 1 the righteous James is using the adjective **righteous** as a noun to refer to a type of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the righteous person” or “the innocent person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
JAS 5 6 lq6p figs-genericnoun τὸν δίκαιον 1 the righteous The expression **the righteous** refers to righteous people in general, not to one specific person. Alternate translation: “righteous people” or “innocent people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
JAS 5 6 z7w1 figs-explicit οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται ὑμῖν 1 He does not resist you This could mean: (1) the innocent people are not able to resist what the rich people are doing. Alternate translation: “He is not able to resist you” (2) the innocent people wanted a peaceful resolution and were not fighting back. Alternate translation: “You have done this even though the innocent person wanted a peaceful resolution” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 5 6 j312 figs-explicit οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται ὑμῖν 1 He does not resist you In light of everything that James says in [5:1-6](../05/01.md), the implications are that even though these innocent people are not able to defend themselves, God will defend them by judging and punishing these rich people. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 5 7 a4sv grammar-connect-logic-result οὖν 1 Therefore James uses **Therefore** to introduce a description of what his readers should do as a result of what he has just said about rich people. He is referring specifically to what he said about God’s judgment being imminent. Alternate translation: “Because you know that God will soon judge the people who are oppressing you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JAS 5 7 j313 figs-metaphor ἀδελφοί 1 brothers See how you translated the term **brothers** in [1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: “my fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 7 wgk4  ἕως τῆς παρουσίας τοῦ Κυρίου 1 until the coming of the Lord James is referring to Jesus by a respectful title. Alternate translation: “until Jesus returns” or “until the Lord Jesus returns”
JAS 5 7 j314 figs-metaphor ἰδοὺ, 1 Behold, The term **Behold** focuses the attention of a listener or reader on what a speaker or writer is about to say. James is using the word here to introduce an analogy, as he makes clear at the start of the next verse. So it may be helpful to express the meaning of **behold** as a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Consider this.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 7 y4er figs-genericnoun ὁ γεωργὸς ἐκδέχεται 1 the farmer awaits The expression **the farmer** refers to farmers in general, not to one specific farmer. Alternate translation: “a farmer awaits” or “farmers await” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
JAS 5 7 j315  τὸν τίμιον καρπὸν τῆς γῆς 1 the valuable fruit of the earth James uses the word **fruit** in a broad sense to mean things that plants produce that are good for food. He does not mean only the kind of fruit that grows on trees and vines. Alternate translation: “the valuable crops that grow from the earth”
JAS 5 7 j316 writing-pronouns μακροθυμῶν ἐπ’ αὐτῷ ἕως λάβῃ 1 waiting patiently for it until it receives If it would be helpful to your readers, you could specify what the pronoun **it** refers to in each of these cases. Alternate translation: “waiting patiently for this fruit until the earth receives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JAS 5 7 j317 figs-nominaladj πρόϊμον καὶ ὄψιμον 1 the early and the late James is using the adjectives **early** and **late** as nouns to refer to types of rain. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “the rain that comes early in the growing season and the rain that comes late in the growing season” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
JAS 5 7 j318 figs-explicit πρόϊμον καὶ ὄψιμον 1 the early and the late If it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not be familiar with rainfed agriculture, you could say why these farmers needed to wait for rain to fall on their crops. UST models one way to do this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 5 8 j319  μακροθυμήσατε καὶ ὑμεῖς 1 You also wait patiently Here James makes clear that what he said about farmers in the previous verse was an analogy for his readers. Alternate translation: “You should also wait patiently, just as a farmer does”
JAS 5 8 bbn1 figs-metaphor στηρίξατε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν 1 Strengthen your hearts James is using the **heart** figuratively to represent the will. Alternate translation: “Stay committed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 8 jw3b  ἡ παρουσία τοῦ Κυρίου ἤγγικεν 1 the coming of the Lord has come near James is referring to Jesus by a respectful title. (By **near** he means near in time. This is not a spatial metaphor.) Alternate translation: “Jesus will return soon” or “the Lord Jesus will return soon”
JAS 5 9 k74r figs-metaphor ἀδελφοί 1 brothers See how you translated the term **brothers** in [1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: “my fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 9 z3p7 figs-activepassive μὴ κριθῆτε 1 you may be not judged If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “God may not judge you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JAS 5 9 ita4 figs-metaphor ἰδοὺ, ὁ κριτὴς 1 Behold, the judge The term **Behold** focuses the attention of a listener or reader on what a speaker or writer is about to say. Alternate translation: “Be aware that the judge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 9 g938 figs-metaphor ὁ κριτὴς πρὸ τῶν θυρῶν ἕστηκεν 1 the judge is standing at the door James is figuratively comparing Jesus to a judge who is just about to walk into a courtroom. Alternate translation: “Jesus will soon return and judge everyone for what they have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 10 j320  ὑπόδειγμα λάβετε, ἀδελφοί, τῆς κακοπαθίας 1 Take an example, brothers, of the suffering Alternate translation: “Take as your example, brothers, the suffering”
JAS 5 10 j321 figs-metaphor ἀδελφοί 1 brothers See how you translated the term **brothers** in [1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: “my fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

JAS 5 11 j322 figs-metaphor τὸ τέλος Κυρίου εἴδετε 1 you have seen the end of the Lord James is continuing to refer to the story of Job. Here, **end** could mean: (1) purpose. In that case, James would be using the term **seen** figuratively to mean “recognized.” Alternate translation: “you have recognized the purpose that the Lord had for Job’s sufferings” (2) final result. In that case, James would be using the term **seen** figuratively to mean “learned.” Alternate translation: “you have learned from the Scriptures how the Lord helped Job in the end” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 11 j323 grammar-connect-logic-result ὅτι πολύσπλαγχνός ἐστιν ὁ Κύριος καὶ οἰκτίρμων 1 that the Lord is greatly compassionate and merciful Here, **that** could mean: (1) “for” and introduce a reason. James may be giving the reason why God was pursuing a good purpose even in Job’s sufferings or why God helped Job in the end. Alternate translation: “for the Lord is very compassionate and merciful” (2) something further that James’ readers would have learned from the story of Job. Alternate translation: “and you have realized from this story that the Lord is greatly compassionate and merciful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JAS 5 12 fug7 figs-metaphor πρὸ πάντων 1 before all James is using a spatial metaphor to emphasize the importance of what he is about to say. Your language may use a different spatial metaphor. Alternate translation: “above all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

JAS 5 12 j324 figs-ellipsis ἤτω…ὑμῶν τὸ ναὶ, ναὶ, καὶ τὸ οὒ, οὔ 1 let your “Yes” be “Yes” and “No,” “No” In the second phrase, James is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from the first phrase. Alternate translation: “let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’ and let your ‘No’ be ‘No’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JAS 5 12 m3ve  ἤτω…ὑμῶν τὸ ναὶ, ναὶ, καὶ τὸ οὒ, οὔ 1 let your “Yes” be “Yes” and “No,” “No” Alternate translation: “simply give your word, without making an oath”
JAS 5 12 f6mx figs-metaphor ἵνα μὴ ὑπὸ κρίσιν πέσητε 1 so that you may not fall under judgment James is speaking figuratively of **judgment** as something that a person might **fall under**. Alternate translation: “so that you will not be judged” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 12 j325 figs-explicit ἵνα μὴ ὑπὸ κρίσιν πέσητε 1 so that you may not fall under judgment If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say more explicitly what this means. Alternate translation: “so that God will not have to judge and punish you for breaking your oath” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 5 13 m3e6 figs-rquestion κακοπαθεῖ τις ἐν ὑμῖν? προσευχέσθω 1 Is anyone among you suffering hardship? Let him pray James is not looking for information. He is using the question form to state a condition, and he describes the result in a short sentence right after the question. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the question and that sentence together as a single statement. Alternate translation: “If anyone among you is suffering hardship, then he should pray” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JAS 5 13 wdf7 figs-rquestion εὐθυμεῖ τις? ψαλλέτω 1 Is anyone cheerful?

JAS 5 14 in34 figs-rquestion ἀσθενεῖ τις ἐν ὑμῖν? προσκαλεσάσθω τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῆς ἐκκλησίας, καὶ προσευξάσθωσαν 1 Is anyone among you sick? Let him summon the elders of the church, and let them pray Once again James is using the question form to state a condition and describing the result in a following sentence. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the question and that sentence together as a single statement. Alternate translation: “If anyone among you sick, then he should summon the elders of the church and they should pray” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JAS 5 14 j326  προσευξάσθωσαν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν, ἀλείψαντες αὐτὸν ἐλαίῳ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Κυρίου 1 let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil in the name of the Lord It is unclear whether James means that the prayer or the anointing is to be done in the name of the Lord.

JAS 5 14 j327 figs-metaphor προσευξάσθωσαν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν 1 pray over him James is using a spatial metaphor to indicate that the sick person is the beneficiary of the elders’ prayers. Alternate translation: “pray for him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 14 j328 translate-unknown ἀλείψαντες αὐτὸν ἐλαίῳ 1 having anointed him with oil In the biblical culture, anointing people with **oil** was a way of consecrating them to God, but it was also a medical treatment. Since James is talking about a person who is **sick**, he seems to speak of the oil at least in part for its medical value. So he may be telling believers to do what they can practically to help the sick person recover, in addition to praying for him. If your readers would not recognize that the medical benefits were one reason why James says to anoint the sick person with oil, you could include an explanation in your translation or in a note, or you could translate this with a general expression. Alternate translation: “having done what they can to help him practically” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
JAS 5 14 fik7 figs-metonymy ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Κυρίου 1 in the name of the Lord James is figuratively using the **name** of the Lord to mean his person and authority. Alternate translation: “on behalf of the Lord” or “with the authority of the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

JAS 5 15 j330 figs-nominaladj ἡ εὐχὴ τῆς πίστεως σώσει τὸν κάμνοντα 1 the prayer of faith will save the sick James is using the adjective **sick** as a noun in order to indicate a type of person.

JAS 5 15 c8q6 figs-personification ἡ εὐχὴ τῆς πίστεως σώσει τὸν κάμνοντα 1 the prayer of faith will save the sick James is speaking figuratively of this **prayer** as if it would heal the sick person itself.

JAS 5 15 j331 figs-activepassive ἀφεθήσεται αὐτῷ 1 it will be forgiven to him If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will forgive him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JAS 5 16 dl5k grammar-connect-logic-result οὖν 1 Therefore James uses **Therefore** to introduce something that believers should do as a result of what he said in the previous verse.

JAS 5 16 j332  πολὺ ἰσχύει δέησις δικαίου ἐνεργουμένη 1 The working prayer of the righteous is very strong The term **working** has the sense of an adverb rather than an adjective. Alternate translation: “The prayer of the righteous is very strong as it is working” or “The prayer of the righteous is very strong in its effects”
JAS 5 16 j333 figs-nominaladj πολὺ ἰσχύει δέησις δικαίου ἐνεργουμένη 1 The working prayer of the righteous is very strong James is using the adjective **righteous** as a noun in order to indicate a type of person.

JAS 5 17 j334 figs-explicit Ἠλείας 1 Elijah James assumes that his readers will know from the Scriptures about this episode in Elijah’s life. If your readers might not be familiar with it, you could describe it in more detail. Alternate translation: “You know from the Scriptures how a prophet named Elijah who lived long ago” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 5 17 j335 figs-explicit ὁμοιοπαθὴς ἡμῖν 1 of similar passions to us This expression means that Elijah had the same feelings as any other human being. In context, James is indicating specifically that he too had the kind of feelings that make it difficult for people to pray. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “who had the same doubts and fears that we all do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JAS 5 17 vhw2 figs-explicitinfo προσευχῇ προσηύξατο 1 he prayed with prayer To indicate that Elijah prayed intensely, James is using an indirect object with a verb that comes from the same root. If your language uses a similar construction, it would be appropriate to have it here in your translation. But if this construction would seem to express unnecessary extra information in your language, you could express this emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “he prayed intensely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
JAS 5 18 j336 writing-pronouns πάλιν προσηύξατο 1 he prayed again The pronoun **he** refers to Elijah. Alternate translation: “Elijah prayed again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

JAS 5 18 yi7m figs-personification ἡ γῆ ἐβλάστησεν τὸν καρπὸν αὐτῆς 1 the earth produced its fruit James is speaking figuratively of the **earth** as if it were a living thing that **produced fruit**. As in [5:7](../05/07.md), James is using the word **fruit** in a broad sense to mean things that plants produce that are good for food. He does not mean only the kind of fruit that grows on trees and vines. Alternate translation: “crops grew from the ground” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JAS 5 19 xr4l figs-metaphor ἀδελφοί μου 1 My brothers See how you translated the term **brothers** in [1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: “My fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

JAS 5 20 j340 writing-pronouns γινωσκέτω 1 let him know The pronoun **him** refers to the person who corrects another believer who has been deceived. Alternate translation: “the person who corrects the deceived believer should know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

JAS 5 20 j342 figs-metonymy σώσει ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἐκ θανάτου 1 will save his soul from death James is speaking figuratively as if this person’s actions would save the sinner’s soul from death.

JAS 5 20 pd78 figs-metaphor σώσει ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἐκ θανάτου 1 will save his soul from death James seems to be speaking not of literal, physical death but of spiritual death, that is, of eternal separation from God. Alternate translation: “from spiritual death” (as in UST) or “from eternal separation from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JAS 5 20 j343 figs-synecdoche σώσει ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἐκ θανάτου 1 will save his soul from death However, some interpreters believe that James actually is speaking of literal, physical death. They believe he is saying that a person who stops his sinful lifestyle will not experience physical death as a consequence of his sin. In that case, James would be using one part of a person, his **soul**, to mean all of the person. Alternate translation: “will keep him from dying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
JAS 5 20 rh4d figs-metaphor καλύψει πλῆθος ἁμαρτιῶν 1 will cover a multitude of sins James is speaking figuratively of one person’s sins as if they were objects that another person could cover so that God would not see them.

1PE front intro c1uv   0  # Introduction to 1 Peter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 1: General Introduction&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Outline of 1 Peter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Introduction (1:1-2)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Praise for God’s salvation of the believers (1:3-2:10)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Christian living (2:11-4:11)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Encouragement to persevere when suffering (4:12-5:11)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Closing (5:12-14)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the Book of 1 Peter?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The Book of 1 Peter was written by the Apostle Peter. He wrote the letter to Gentile Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the Book of 1 Peter about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Peter wrote this letter to help encourage and testify to &amp;quot;the true grace of God” so that the Gentile believers would stand firm &amp;quot;in it&amp;quot; (5:12).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;He encouraged Christians to continue obeying God even when they are suffering. He told them to do this because Jesus will return soon. Peter also gave instructions about Christians submitting to persons in authority.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title “1 Peter” or “First Peter.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The First Letter from Peter” or “The First Letter Peter Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How were Christians treated in Rome?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Peter probably was in Rome when he wrote this letter. He gave Rome the symbolic name of “Babylon” (5:13). It appears that when Peter wrote this letter, Romans were badly persecuting Christians.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Singular and plural “you”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this book, the word “I” refers to Peter, except for two places: [1 Peter 1:16](../01/16.md) and [1 Peter 2:6](../02/06.md). The word “you” is always plural and refers to Peter’s audience. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Peter?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;“You made your souls pure by obedience to the truth. This was for the purpose of sincere brotherly love; so love one another earnestly from the heart” (1:22). The ULT, UST, and most other modern versions read this way. Some older versions read, “You made your souls pure by obedience to the truth through the Spirit for the purpose of sincere brotherly love, so love one another earnestly from the heart.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1PE 1 intro ql4i   0  # 1 Peter 1 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Peter formally introduces this letter in verses 1-2. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 1:24-25.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What God reveals&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;When Jesus comes again, everyone will see how good God’s people were to have faith in Jesus. Then God’s people will see how gracious God has been to them, and all people will praise both God and his people.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Holiness&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;God wants his people to be holy because God is holy (1:15). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Eternity&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Peter tells Christians to live for things that will last forever and not to live for the things of this world, which will end. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Paradox&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Peter writes that his readers are glad and sad at the same time ([1 Peter 1:6](../01/06.md)). He can say this because they are sad because they are suffering, but they are glad because they know that God will save them “in the last time” ([1 Peter 1:5](../01/05.md))
1PE 1 1 g6b4   0 General Information: Peter identifies himself as the writer and identifies and greets the believers to whom he is writing.
1PE 1 1 u3zc figs-metaphor ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις διασπορᾶς 1 to the elect foreigners of the dispersion Peter speaks of his readers as people who live as **exiles**since they are far from their homes in many different countries because of **the dispersion**.

1PE 1 2 z7df figs-abstractnouns χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη 1 May grace be to you, and may your peace increase This passage speaks of **grace** as if it were an object that believers could possess, and of **peace** as if it were something that could increase in amount. Of course, grace is in reality the kind way God acts toward believers, and peace is how believers live in safety and joy with God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE 1 3 y6aq   0 General Information: Peter begins to talk about the believers’ salvation and faith. Here he elaborates on a metaphor in which what God promises to do for all believers is spoken of as if it were an inheritance that he passes on to them.

1PE 1 4 cy1g figs-metaphor κληρονομίαν 1 an … inheritance Receiving what God has promised believers is spoken of as if it were inheriting property and wealth from a family member. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE 1 4 vr9s figs-metaphor ἄφθαρτον, καὶ ἀμίαντον, καὶ ἀμάραντον 1 imperishable and undefiled and unfading Peter uses three similar phrases to describe the inheritance as something that is perfect and eternal. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE 1 4 z6w4 figs-activepassive τετηρημένην ἐν οὐρανοῖς εἰς ὑμᾶς 1 reserved in heaven for you You can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “which God is reserving in heaven for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

1PE 1 5 fw3p figs-abstractnouns ἐν δυνάμει Θεοῦ 1 by the power of God Here, **power** is a way of saying that God is strong and able to protect believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE 1 5 a4ab figs-abstractnouns διὰ πίστεως 1 through faith Here, **faith** refers to the fact that the believers trust in Christ. Alternate translation: “because of your faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE 1 5 g4rb figs-activepassive ἑτοίμην ἀποκαλυφθῆναι 1 that is ready to be revealed You can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “that God is ready to reveal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1PE 1 6 hy8d  ἐν ᾧ ἀγαλλιᾶσθε 1 In this you greatly rejoice The word **this** refers to all the blessings that Peter mentions in the previous verses.
1PE 1 7 vvp1 figs-metaphor ἵνα τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως 1 so that the proof of your faith In the same way in which fire refines gold, hardships test how well believers trust in Christ. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE 1 7 ct3n  τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως 1 the proof of your faith God wishes to test how well believers trust in Christ.
1PE 1 7 u63m  ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως πολυτιμότερον χρυσίου τοῦ ἀπολλυμένου, διὰ πυρὸς δὲ δοκιμαζομένου 1 of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes. But, being tested by fire **Faith** is more valuable than **gold**, because gold does not last forever, even if it is refined in **fire**.
1PE 1 7 a6q4  εὑρεθῇ εἰς ἔπαινον, καὶ δόξαν, καὶ τιμὴν 1 it might be found to result in praise, and glory, and honor This could mean: (1) God will honor them very highly because of their faith. (2) Their faith will bring praise, glory, and honor to God.

Or he could have been referring to Rome because the Romans were persecuting the Christians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

2PE front intro mvk9   0  # Introduction to 2 Peter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 1: General Introduction&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Outline of the book of 2 Peter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Introduction (1:1–2)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Reminder to live godly lives because God has enabled us to do so (1:3–15)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Reminder of the veracity of apostolic teaching (1:16–21)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Prediction of false teachers (2:1–3)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Examples of divine judgment (2:4–10a)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Description and denunciation of false teachers (2:10b–22)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Reminder that Jesus will return at the right time (3:1–13)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Concluding exhortation to live godly lives (3:14–17)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the book of 2 Peter?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The author identified himself as Simon Peter. Simon Peter was an apostle. He also wrote the book of 1 Peter. Peter probably wrote this letter while in a prison in Rome, just before he died. Peter called this letter his second letter, so we can date it after 1 Peter. He addressed the letter to the same audience as his first letter. The audience probably was Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the book of 2 Peter about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Peter wrote this letter to encourage believers to live good lives. He warned them about false teachers who were saying Jesus was taking too long to return. He told them that Jesus was not slow in returning. Instead, God was giving people time to repent so that they would be saved.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Peter” or “Second Peter.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The Second Letter from Peter” or “The Second Letter Peter Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who were the people Peter spoke against?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;It is possible that the people Peter spoke against were those who would become known as Gnostics. These teachers distorted the teachings of Scripture for their own gain. They lived in immoral ways and taught others to do the same.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What does it mean that God inspired Scripture?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The doctrine of Scripture is a very important one. 2 Peter helps readers to understand that while each writer of Scripture had his own distinct way of writing, God is the true author of Scripture (1:20-21).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Singular and plural “you”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this book, the word “I” refers to Peter. Also, the word “you” is always plural and refers to Peter’s audience. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What are the major issues in the text of the book of 2 Peter?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;For the following verses, there are differences between some of the ancient manuscripts. The ULT text follows the reading that most scholars consider to be original and puts the other reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the language of wider communication in the region, translators may want to consider using the reading found in that version. If not, translators are advised to follow the reading in the ULT.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “to be kept in chains of lower darkness until the judgment” (2:4). Some ancient manuscripts have, “to be kept in pits of lower darkness until the judgment.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “They enjoy their deceitful actions while they are feasting with you” (2:13). Some manuscripts have, “They enjoy their actions while they are feasting with you in love feasts.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “Bosor” (2:15). A few other manuscripts read, “Beor.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “The elements will be burned with fire, and the earth and the deeds in it will be revealed” (3:10). Other manuscripts have, “The elements will be burned with fire, and the earth and the deeds in it will be burned up.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
2PE 1 intro wjw5   0  # 2 Peter 1 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and Formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Introduction (1:1–2)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Reminder to live good lives, because God has enabled us to do so (1:3–15)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;3. Reminder of the veracity of apostolic teaching (1:16–21)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Peter begins this letter in [1:1–2](../01/01.md) by giving his name, identifying the people to whom he is writing, and offering a greeting. That was the way people typically began letters at this time.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special Concepts in this Chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Knowledge of God&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Having experiential knowledge of God means to belong to him or to have a relationship with him. Here, “knowledge” is more than just mentally knowing about God. It is the knowledge of personal relationship in which God saves a person and gives him grace and peace. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/know]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Living godly lives&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Peter teaches that God has given believers all that they need for living godly lives. Therefore, believers should do everything they can to obey God more and more. If believers continue to do this, then they will be effective and productive through their relationship with Jesus. However, if believers do not continue living godly lives, then it is as though they have forgotten what God did through Christ to save them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### The truth of Scripture&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Peter teaches that the prophecies in Scripture were not made up by men. The Holy Spirit revealed God’s message to the men who spoke them or wrote them down. Also, Peter and the other apostles did not make up the stories they told people about Jesus. They witnessed what Jesus did and heard God call Jesus his son.
2PE 1 1 n1di figs-123person Σίμων Πέτρος 1 General Information: In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, and they would refer to themselves in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the first person. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, you could also use that. Alternate translation: “I, Simon Peter, am writing this letter” or “From Simon Peter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
2PE 1 1 xf2u translate-names Σίμων Πέτρος 1  **Simon Peter** is the name of a man, a disciple of Jesus. See the information about him in Part 1 of the Introduction to 2 Peter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2PE 1 1 v381 figs-distinguish δοῦλος καὶ ἀπόστολος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ 1 a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ This phrase gives further information about Simon Peter. He describes himself as being both a **servant of Jesus Christ** and one given the position and authority of being Christ’s **apostle**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
2PE 1 1 mbg7 figs-123person τοῖς…λαχοῦσιν 1 to those who have received In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would then say to whom they were writing, naming those people in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the second person. Alternate translation: “to you who have received” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
2PE 1 1 yy7j figs-explicit τοῖς ἰσότιμον ἡμῖν λαχοῦσιν πίστιν 1 to those who have received the same precious faith That these people have **received a faith** implies that God has given that faith to them. Alternate translation: “to those to whom God has given a faith equal in value with us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2PE 1 1 x186 figs-abstractnouns τοῖς ἰσότιμον…λαχοῦσιν πίστιν 1  If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** with a verb, such as “trust” or “believe.” Alternate translation: “to those whom God has made to trust” or “to those whom God has made to believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2PE 1 1 y157 figs-exclusive ἡμῖν 1 with us Here, the word **us** refers to Peter and the other apostles, but not to those to whom he is writing. Alternate translation: “as we apostles have received” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2PE 1 1 xdyd  ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ 1  The word **by** indicates the means through which they received the faith. Alternate translation: “by means of the righteousness”
2PE 1 1 fpsl figs-abstractnouns δικαιοσύνῃ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν καὶ Σωτῆρος 1  If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind the abstract noun **righteousness** with an adjective such as “righteous” or “right.” Alternate translation: “the righteous acts of our God and Savior” or “the right way of our God and Savior” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2PE 1 2 oaej translate-blessing χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη 1  In this culture, letter writers would offer a good wish for the recipient before introducing the main business of the letter.

1JN front intro nl27   0  # Introduction to 1 John&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 1: General Introduction&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Outline of the book of 1 John&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This is a letter that the apostle John wrote to challenge and correct false teachings that were leading followers of Jesus to believe wrong things and live in wrong ways. At that time, the letter form had distinct opening and closing sections. The main body of the letter came in between.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Opening of Letter (1:1-4)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Main Body of Letter (1:5–5:12)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Genuine believers obey God and love one another (1:5–2:17)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * It is false teaching to deny that Jesus is the Messiah (2:18–2:27)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Genuine children of God do not sin (2:28–3:10)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Genuine believers help one another sacrificially (3:11–18)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Genuine believers have confidence in prayer (3:19–24)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * It is false teaching to deny that Jesus became human (4:1–6)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * Genuine believers love one another as God has loved them (4:7–21)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    * It is false teaching to deny that Jesus is the Son of God (5:1–12)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Closing of Letter (5:13-21)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the book of 1 John?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The author of this letter does not give his name. However, since early Christian times, the church has widely considered the apostle John to be the author. He wrote the Gospel of John, and there are many similarities between the content of that book and this letter. If John did write this letter, he probably did so near the end of his life.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### To whom was the book of 1 John written?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The author wrote this letter to people whom he addresses as “beloved” and, figuratively, as “my little children.” This probably refers to believers in various churches located in the area where John was then living.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the book of 1 John about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;False teachers were encouraging followers of Jesus to believe wrong things and to live in wrong ways. John wanted to challenge and correct those false teachings so that the people who received his letter would continue to believe the truth that they had been taught and live in right ways. The false teachers were saying that these people were not saved; John wanted to assure them that they were saved.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “1 John” or “First John.” They may also choose a different title, such as “The First Letter from John” or “The First Letter John Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who were the people whom John spoke against?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The false teachers whom John was challenging seem to have held beliefs similar to what would later become known as Gnosticism. Those false teachers believed that the physical world was evil. They thought that God would not become human, since they considered the physical body to be evil, so they denied that Jesus was God come to earth in human form. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “sin”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In chapter 1, John says that we should not deny that we have sinned. Rather, if we confess our sin, God will forgive us. In chapter 2, John says that he is writing this letter so that the recipients will not sin, but he adds that if they do sin, Jesus will advocate on their behalf. But in chapter 3, John says that everyone who has been begotten from God and who remains in God does not commit sin and is not able to sin. And in chapter 5, John says that we should not pray for people who are sinning in certain ways, although we should pray for people who are sinning in other ways. This may seem confusing and contradictory.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;However, the explanation is that the people whose teachings John challenged and corrected in this letter were saying that it did not matter what people did in their bodies. This was because they thought that physical matter was evil, and so they thought that God did not care about it. In effect, they were saying that there was no such thing as sin. So John needed to say, in chapter 1, that sin is real and that everyone has sinned. Some of the believers may have been deceived by the false teaching and committed sins, so John also needed to reassure them that if they repented and confessed their sins, God would forgive them. John says similar things in chapter 2. Then in chapter 3 he explains that the new nature that believers have as children of God is one that does not want to sin and that does not enjoy sinning. So they should recognize that those who excuse or condone sin are not truly children of God, and that as children of God themselves, they can become more and more obedient and free from sin. Finally, in chapter 5, John warns that if a person sins wantonly and continually, this likely means that they have rejected Jesus and are not influenced by the Holy Spirit. He says that in that case, it may not be effective to pray for them. But he then encourages his readers that if a person sins occasionally but feels remorse, he is influenced by the Spirit, and so the prayers of other believers will help him repent and live in a right way again. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/forgive]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “remain”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this letter, John often uses the word “remain” (which could also be translated as “reside” or “abide”) as a spatial metaphor. John speaks of a believer becoming more faithful to Jesus and knowing Jesus better as if the teaching of Jesus “remained” in the believer. He speaks of a person being spiritually joined to someone else as if that person “remained” in the other person: He writes that Christians “remain” in Christ and in God, and he says that the Father “remains” in the Son, the Son “remains” in the Father, the Son “remains” in believers, and the Holy Spirit “remains” in believers.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may find it difficult to represent these ideas in their own languages if they try to use exactly the same words and expressions each time. For example, in [2:6](../02/06.md), when John speaks of a believer “remaining” in God, he intends to express the idea of that believer being spiritually unified with God. Accordingly, UST speaks of how the believer “shares life with God.” To give another example, for the statement in [2:14](../02/14.md) that “the word of God remains in you,” UST says, “you continue to obey what God commands.” This shows how other expressions can be found that accurately communicate the various ideas that John is expressing through the term “remain.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “appear”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In several places in this letter, John uses a term that ULT usually translates as “appear.” This is actually a passive verbal form in Greek, but as is often the case with such forms in that language, it can have an active meaning. When it has an active meaning, it is important to recognize that it does not simply mean “seemed to be there,” as the word “appeared” might suggest. Rather, it means “came to be there.” This is illustrated well by the use of the term in another New Testament book, 2 Corinthians, in which Paul writes in [5:10](../2co/05/10.md) that “we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.” Clearly this does not mean that we must only seem to be present there. Rather, we must actually arrive there.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Throughout the epistle, it is a subtle matter of interpretation to decide whether John is using the term “appear” in an active sense or in a passive sense. For example, in [1:2](../01/02.md), John applies the term twice to the “Word of life,” that is, to Jesus. But it is not clear whether he is saying that Jesus himself “appeared,” that is, he came to earth, or that he “was made apparent” (made visible), with the emphasis on the idea that God revealed Jesus to the world and in the process revealed himself to the world through Jesus. At each place where John uses this term, notes will call attention to it and discuss what it likely means in that context.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “the world”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;John also uses the term “world” in a variety of senses in this letter. It can mean the earth, something material, the people who live in the world, the people who do not honor God, or the values of the people who do not honor God. Notes will address the meaning of the term “world” in each instance where John uses it.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “to know”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The verb “to know” is used in two different ways in this letter. Sometimes it is used about knowing a fact, as in 3:2, 3:5, and 3:19. Sometimes it means to experience and understand someone or something, as in 3:1, 3:6, 3:16, and 3:20. Sometimes John uses it in two different senses in the same sentence, as in 2:3, “in this we know that we have known him.” Your language may have different words for these different meanings. If so, you must be careful to use the appropriate word in the right place in your translation.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “We”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In most cases in this letter, the first-person plural pronouns (“we, our,” etc.) are inclusive, and so if your language marks that distinction, use the inclusive form in your translation. In those cases, John is speaking of what both he and the recipients know, or of things that are true of both him and the recipients. However, in a few cases, the first-person pronouns are exclusive, since John is telling the recipients what he and his fellow apostles saw and heard from Jesus. The notes will identify all such places, and in them you should use the exclusive forms, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “You, your”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The words “you” and “your” in this letter are plural.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Light and darkness&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In 1:5-7 and 2:8-11 John uses an extended metaphor in which light represents what is good or holy and darkness represents what is evil. If this is not easily understood in your language, you may need to say explicitly that light represents goodness or that light is like goodness, or you may choose to talk about goodness without using the symbol of light. There will be a note explaining the metaphor in each place. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Major textual issues in the text of the book of 1 John&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;When ancient manuscripts of the Bible differ, ULT puts the reading that scholars consider to be the most accurate in its text, but it puts other possibly accurate readings in footnotes. The introductions to each chapter will discuss places where the ancient manuscripts differ in significant ways, and notes will address those places again where they occur in the book. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using the readings found in that version. If not, we recommend that you follow the readings in the ULT text.

1JN 1 intro ab9v   0  # 1 John 1 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Opening of the letter (1:1-4)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Genuine believers obey God and love one another (1:5–10, continues through 2:17)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Important translation issues in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Like many Greek compositions of this time, for stylistic purposes this letter begins with a very long sentence. It goes from the beginning of [1:1](../01/01.md) to the middle of [1:3](../01/03.md). The parts of this sentence are not in the order that is customary in many languages. The direct object comes first, and it is very long, made up of many different clauses. The subject and verb do not come until near the end. And in the middle, there is a long digression. So it will be a challenge to translate.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;One approach that might work well in your language would be to create a verse bridge that includes all of 1:1–3. You could break up this long sentence into several smaller sentences, repeating the subject and verb for clarity. This would allow you to present the parts of the sentence in an order that might be more customary in your language and that your readers might understand better. Here is an example of 1 John 1:1-3 rearranged into an order that might be clearer in your language:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;“So that you will have fellowship with us, we are declaring to you what we have seen and heard. We are declaring to you what was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched. It has to do with the Word of life. Indeed, the life appeared, and we have seen it, and we are testifying to it. Yes, we are announcing to you the eternal life that was with the Father and that then came to us.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;If you take this approach, another way to translate the second sentence would be, “We are declaring to you what was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and our hands have touched.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Another approach that could also work well, and which would not require a verse bridge, would be to leave the phrases in their present order, but to divide the sentence into three parts at the verse divisions. If you do that, you could also put your translation of the phrase “regarding the Word of life” at the beginning rather than the end of [1:1](../01/01.md) and present it as a topical introduction to the letter. Otherwise, your readers might not get the sense that this is a letter until they reached [1:4](../01/04.md), where John formally states his purpose for writing.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The notes to [1:1–4](../01/01.md) provide further specific suggestions for how to translate this long opening sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Important textual issues in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [1:4](../01/04.md), the most accurate ancient manuscripts read “so that our joy may be fulfilled.” ULT follows that reading. However, some other ancient manuscripts read “your joy” instead of “our joy.” If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using whichever reading is found in that version. If a translation does not already exist, we recommend that you follow the reading in the ULT text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1JN 1 1 honh checking/headings  0  If you are using section headings, you could put one here before verse 1. Suggested heading: “The Word of Life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/checking/headings]])

If you follow the suggestion to translate the phrase **regarding the Word of life** as a topical introduction to this letter, you will already have indicated that the four clauses in this verse refer to a person, Jesus. If you have pronouns in your language that refer to people, such as “he,” “who,” and “whom,” it would be appropriate to use them here. Alternate translation: “Regarding the Word of life—he is the one who has existed from all eternity, whom we heard speak, whom we saw with our own eyes, and whom we looked at and touched with our own hands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 1 1 j364 figs-idiom ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς 1 from the beginning John uses the phrase **from the beginning** in various ways in this letter. Here it refers to the fact that Jesus has always existed. Alternate translation: “from all eternity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 1 1 jd7p figs-exclusive ἀκηκόαμεν…ἑωράκαμεν…ἡμῶν…ἐθεασάμεθα…ἡμῶν 1 we have heard … we have seen … our … we have looked at … our Here the pronouns **we** and **our** are exclusive, since John is speaking on behalf of himself and the other eyewitnesses to the earthly life of Jesus, but the people to whom he is writing did not see Jesus. So use exclusive forms here, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1JN 1 1 ej5x figs-explicit ἀκηκόαμεν 1 we have heard The implication is that what John and the other eyewitnesses **heard** was Jesus speaking. If it would be clearer in your language, you can include this information, as in the UST. Alternate translation: “we heard speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 1 1 rb73 figs-parallelism ὃ ἑωράκαμεν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς ἡμῶν, ὃ ἐθεασάμεθα 1 which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at These two phrases mean the same thing. John is likely using the repetition for emphasis. You could combine these phrases and show the emphasis in another way if that would be clearer for your readers. Alternate translation: “whom we saw clearly ourselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1JN 1 1 j001 figs-explicitinfo ἑωράκαμεν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς ἡμῶν…καὶ αἱ χεῖρες ἡμῶν ἐψηλάφησαν 1 which we have seen with our eyes … and our hands have touched In your language, it might seem that these phrases express unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate them. However, your language may have its own way of using such extra information for emphasis, and you could also do that in your translation. Alternate translation: “we saw … and touched” or “we saw with our own eyes … and touched with our own hands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
1JN 1 1 j002 figs-explicit ἑωράκαμεν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς ἡμῶν…αἱ χεῖρες ἡμῶν ἐψηλάφησαν 1 which we have seen with our eyes … and our hands have touched The false teachers were denying that Jesus was a real human being and saying that he was only a spirit. But the implications of what John is saying here are that Jesus was a real human being. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 1 1 j003  περὶ τοῦ λόγου τῆς ζωῆς 1 regarding the Word of life As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, you could put your translation of this phrase, **regarding the Word of life**, at the beginning of this verse and present it as a sentence of its own as a topical introduction to the letter, as UST does. Alternate translation: “We are writing to you about Jesus, the Word of life”
1JN 1 1 j004 writing-pronouns περὶ τοῦ λόγου τῆς ζωῆς 1 regarding the Word of life Letter writers of this time typically began by giving their own names. That is the case for most of the letters in the New Testament. This letter is an exception, but if it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply John’s name here, as UST does. As noted above, John uses the plural pronoun “we” because he is speaking on behalf of himself and the other eyewitnesses to Jesus’ earthly life. But it may be more natural in your language for him to refer to himself with a singular pronoun, and if so, you could do that in your translation. Alternate translation: “I, John, am writing to you about Jesus, the Word of life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 1 1 gt44 figs-explicit τοῦ λόγου τῆς ζωῆς 1 the Word of life Here, **the Word of life** is implicitly a description of Jesus. As the General Introduction explains, there are many similarities between this letter and the Gospel of John. That gospel begins by saying about Jesus, “In the beginning was the Word.” So it is likely that when John speaks in this letter of **the Word of life** that “was from the beginning,” he is also speaking about Jesus. ULT indicates this by capitalizing **Word** to indicate that this is a title for Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus, the Word of God, who gives life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 1 1 j005 figs-possession τῆς ζωῆς 1 of life This could be referring either to the life that Jesus has or to the life that Jesus gives. But since John is writing this letter to reassure believers, it seems more likely that this expression is referring to the **life** that “the Word” (Jesus) gives to those who believe. Alternate translation: “who gives life to everyone who believes in him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1JN 1 1 i8b4 figs-metaphor τῆς ζωῆς 1 of life In this letter, John uses **life** in different ways, either to refer literally to physical life or figuratively to spiritual life. Here the reference is to spiritual life. Alternate translation: “of spiritual life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 1 2 la4a figs-activepassive καὶ ἡ ζωὴ ἐφανερώθη 1 indeed, the life appeared See the discussion of the term “appear” in Part 3 of the Introduction to 1 John. Here the term could mean one of two things. (1) John could be emphasizing how Jesus came to this earth. (UST brings this out by saying “he came here to the earth.”) In that case, this would be a situation in which a Greek passive verbal form has an active meaning. As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Indeed, the life came right here” (2) John could be emphasizing how God revealed Jesus to the world and thereby revealed himself to the world through Jesus. To bring out that emphasis, you could translate this with a passive verbal form or, if your language does not use passive forms, you could use an active form and say who did the action. Alternate translation: “Indeed, the life was made visible” or “Indeed, God made the life visible” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1JN 1 2 j006 figs-metonymy ἡ ζωὴ 1 the life John is speaking figuratively of Jesus, whom he calls the “Word of life” in the previous verse, by referring to the **life** that is associated with him. In this case it seems to describe the **life** that Jesus embodies rather than the **life** that he gives. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “Jesus, who is life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1JN 1 2 j007 figs-exclusive ἑωράκαμεν…μαρτυροῦμεν…ἀπαγγέλλομεν…ἡμῖν 1 we have seen … we are bearing witness … we are announcing … us John is speaking on behalf of himself and the other eyewitnesses to the earthly life of Jesus, so the pronouns **we** and **us** are exclusive in this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1JN 1 2 j008 figs-you ὑμῖν 1 you As the General Introduction explains, John is writing this letter to believers in various churches, and so the pronouns **you**, “your,” and “yourselves” are plural throughout the entire letter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
1JN 1 2 jp6s writing-pronouns ἑωράκαμεν, καὶ μαρτυροῦμεν, 1 we have seen it, and we are testifying to it If you decided to use personal pronouns in [1:1](../01/01.md), you could use them in these cases as well. Alternate translation: “we have seen him, and we are testifying that we saw him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 1 2 ih36 figs-parallelism μαρτυροῦμεν, καὶ ἀπαγγέλλομεν ὑμῖν 1 we are testifying to it, yes, we are announcing to you These two phrases mean similar things. John is likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases and express the emphasis in another way, as UST does. Alternate translation: “we are enthusiastically telling you about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1JN 1 2 lyt6 figs-metonymy τὴν ζωὴν τὴν αἰώνιον 1 the eternal life As earlier in the verse, John is speaking figuratively of Jesus by referring to the **life** that is associated with him.

1JN 1 2 itv8 guidelines-sonofgodprinciples τὸν Πατέρα 1 the Father The title **the Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1JN 1 2 fru2 figs-activepassive καὶ ἐφανερώθη ἡμῖν 1 and appeared to us See how you translated **appeared** earlier in this verse.

You could move the clause beginning with **so you also** to the beginning of the verse, since that clause gives the reason for the action that the rest of the verse describes. For clarity, you could also place the direct-object clause **what we have seen and heard** after the subject and verb **we declare … to you**. In that case, you would not need to translate **also** after **declare**. As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “So that you also may have fellowship with us, we are declaring to you what we have seen and heard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1JN 1 3 vw2w figs-explicit ὃ ἑωράκαμεν, καὶ ἀκηκόαμεν 1 what we have seen and heard John is referring implicitly to the way that he and the other eyewitnesses had **seen and heard** Jesus when he was alive on earth.

Alternate translation: “what we saw and heard of Jesus when he was alive on earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 1 3 j010 figs-exclusive ἑωράκαμεν, καὶ ἀκηκόαμεν, ἀπαγγέλλομεν…ἡμῶν 1 we have seen and heard, we declare … us John is speaking on behalf of himself and the other eyewitnesses to the earthly life of Jesus, so the pronouns **we** and **us** are exclusive.

1JN 1 3 tf4m figs-exclusive ἡ κοινωνία…ἡ ἡμετέρα 1 our fellowship is The word **our** here is likely inclusive, since John is writing to fellow believers. So if your language marks that distinction, you should translate the term as inclusive. Even if your language does not mark that distinction, you can indicate in your translation that the term applies both to John and to the people he is writing to. Alternate translation: “we are all close friends” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1JN 1 3 rxq7 guidelines-sonofgodprinciples τοῦ Πατρὸς…τοῦ Υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ 1 the Father … his Son These are important titles. Alternate translation: “God the Father … his Son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1JN 1 4 j011 writing-pronouns ταῦτα γράφομεν ἡμεῖς 1 we are writing these things As the General Notes to this chapter explain, here John is formally stating his purpose for writing. If you decided in [1:1](../01/01.md) that it would be more natural in your language for him to refer to himself with a singular pronoun in such a context, you could do the same thing here. Alternate translation: “I, John, am writing these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 1 4 j012 figs-exclusive ἡμεῖς…ἡμῶν 1 we … our If you use the plural pronoun **we** here, it would be exclusive, since John is speaking of himself and the other eyewitnesses on whose behalf he is writing. However, the term **our** in the second clause is likely inclusive, since John probably means that he wants both himself and his readers to have **joy** in the shared fellowship with one another and with the Father and the Son that he describes in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1JN 1 4 j013 translate-textvariants ἡ χαρὰ ἡμῶν 1 so that our joy may be fulfilled See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to follow the reading of ULT and say **our joy** or to follow the reading of some other versions and say “your joy.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1JN 1 4 j014 figs-you ἡ χαρὰ ἡμῶν 1 so that our joy may be fulfilled If you follow the variant reading “your joy” here instead of **our joy**, the word “your” would be plural, as in the rest of this letter, since it would refer to a group of believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
1JN 1 4 xn9d figs-abstractnouns ἵνα ἡ χαρὰ ἡμῶν ᾖ πεπληρωμένη 1 so that our joy may be fulfilled If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **joy** with an adjective such as “happy.” Alternate translation: “so that we will be completely happy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1JN 1 4 j015 figs-activepassive ἵνα ἡ χαρὰ ἡμῶν ᾖ πεπληρωμένη 1 so that our joy may be fulfilled If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “so that we will be completely happy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

1JN 1 5 j019 figs-doublenegatives σκοτία ἐν αὐτῷ, οὐκ ἔστιν οὐδεμία 1 darkness is not in him at all John is using a double negative in Greek for emphasis. In English it would come out as, “darkness is not in him not at all.” In Greek the second negative does not cancel the first negative to create a positive meaning. In English the meaning would inaccurately be positive, which is why ULT uses only one negative and says “darkness is not in him at all.” But if your language uses double negatives for emphasis that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

1JN 2 intro zjj9   0  # 1 John 2 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Genuine believers obey God and love one another (2:1–17, continuing from 1:5)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. It is false teaching to deny that Jesus is the Messiah (2:18–2:27)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;3. Genuine children of God do not sin (2:28–29, continues through 3:10)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In order to show that John is writing something like poetry in [2:12–14](../02/12.md), some translations set the statements in those verses farther to the right than the rest of the text, and they begin a new line at the start of each statement.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Antichrist&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [2:18](../02/18.md) and [2:22](../02/22.md), John writes both about a specific person called the Antichrist and about many people who will be “antichrists.” The word “antichrist” means “opposed to Christ.” The Antichrist is a person who will come just before the return of Jesus and imitate Jesus’ work, but he will do that for evil purposes. Before that person comes, there will be many other people who work against Christ. They too are called “antichrists,” but as a description rather than as a name. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/antichrist]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Important textual issues in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [2:20](../02/20.md), some ancient manuscripts read “you all know,” and that is the reading that ULT follows. However, other ancient manuscripts read “you know all things.” It seems more likely, based on everything else in the letter, that “you all know” is the correct original reading, since John is countering the claim of false teachers to know more than other believers. The reading “you know all things” seems to have arisen because copyists felt a need to have an object for the verb “know.” Nevertheless, if a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using whichever reading is found in that version. If a translation does not already exist, we recommend that you follow the reading in the ULT text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

They are under his spiritual care, and so he regards them in that sense as if they were his own children.

1JN 2 5 aqa4 figs-idiom τηρῇ αὐτοῦ τὸν λόγον 1 keeps his word In this instance, the word **keep** is an idiom that means “obey.” Alternate translation: “obeys God&amp;apos;s commandments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 2 5 j059 writing-pronouns αὐτοῦ…αὐτῷ 1 his … him The pronouns **his** and **him** in this verse refer to God. Alternate translation: “God’s … God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 2 5 x88p figs-possession ἀληθῶς ἐν τούτῳ ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ τετελείωται 1 in this one truly the love of God has been perfected The phrase **the love of God** could mean one of two things. (1) It could refer to a person loving God. Alternate translation: “that person indeed loves God completely” (2) It could refer to God loving people. Alternate translation: “God’s love has completely achieved its purpose in that person’s life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1JN 2 5 j060 figs-activepassive ἀληθῶς ἐν τούτῳ ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ τετελείωται 1 in this one truly the love of God has been perfected If it would be clearer in your language, you could use an active verbal form in place of the passive verbal form **has been perfected**. The person or thing doing the action will depend on how you decide to translate the phrase **the love of God**. Alternate translation: “that person indeed loves God completely” or “God’s love has completely achieved its purpose in that person’s life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1JN 2 5 jdzb figs-metaphor ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ ἐσμεν 1  The word **this** could be referring to (1) what John is about to say in verse 6, or (2) what John has just said in verse 5, or (3) both. If your language allows it, you could choose option (3), since both verses are talking about completely obeying God, but most languages will need to choose one or the other. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 2 5 b688 figs-metaphor ἐν αὐτῷ ἐσμεν 1 we are in him John is speaking figuratively as if believers could be inside of God. This expression describes having a close relationship with God. Alternate translation: “we are living in fellowship with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 2 6 u6lu figs-metaphor ἐν αὐτῷ μένειν 1 he remains in him See the discussion of the term “remain” in Part 3 of the Introduction to this book. Here to **remain in** God means very much the same thing as to have “fellowship with God” in [1:3](../01/03.md) and [1:6](../01/06.md) and to “be in” God in [2:5](../02/05.md). John is repeating the same idea in different ways. Alternate translation: “he has close fellowship with God” or “he shares life with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 2 6 j061 figs-metaphor ἐν αὐτῷ μένειν 1 he remains in him John once again speaks figuratively as if believers could be inside of God. Alternate translation: “he is close friends with God” or “he shares life with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

1JN 2 6 x5n1 figs-metaphor ὀφείλει καθὼς ἐκεῖνος περιεπάτησεν, καὶ αὐτὸς περιπατεῖν 1 ought, just as that one walked, also to walk himself As in [1:6](../01/06.md) and [1:7](../01/07.md), John is using the word **walk** figuratively to mean how a person lives and behaves. Alternate translation: “must live as Jesus lived” or “must obey God just as Jesus did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 2 6 lvw4 figs-explicit ὀφείλει καθὼς ἐκεῖνος περιεπάτησεν, καὶ αὐτὸς περιπατεῖν 1  John is referring specifically to the way that Jesus behaved when he lived on earth. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “must walk in the same way as Jesus walked when he was living on earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 2 6 j063 writing-pronouns ἐκεῖνος 1 that one John is using this demonstrative pronoun to refer to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 2 7 py9g figs-nominaladj ἀγαπητοί 1 Beloved This is another term of affection by which John addresses the believers to whom he is writing. It involves using the adjective **beloved** as a noun in order to indicate a specific group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “You people whom I love” or “My dear friends” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1JN 2 7 vz9w figs-idiom ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς 1 from the beginning John uses the phrase **from the beginning** in various ways in this letter. Here it refers to the time when the people to whom he is writing first believed in Jesus. Alternate translation: “ever since you first believed in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 2 7 eia9 figs-metonymy ὁ λόγος ὃν ἠκούσατε 1 the word that you heard John is using **word** figuratively to refer to the message that these believers heard, which was communicated through words. Alternate translation: “the message that you heard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1JN 2 7 amu6 figs-explicit ὁ λόγος ὃν ἠκούσατε 1 the word that you heard The implication is that the specific **word** or message that John is describing is the commandment Jesus gave to believers that they should love one another. See the Gospel of John [13:34](../jhn/13/34.md) and [15:12](../jhn/15/12.md). John indicates this explicitly in this letter in [3:23](../03/23.md) and [4:21](../04/21.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly at this point as well. Alternate translation: “the commandment Jesus gave that we should love one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 2 8 j064 figs-idiom πάλιν 1 Again John is using the term **Again** idiomatically in the sense of “Looking at this again from another perspective.” Alternate translation: “On the other hand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 2 8 i1up figs-explicit ἐντολὴν καινὴν γράφω ὑμῖν 1 I am writing a new commandment to you John is referring to the same **commandment** as in [2:7](../02/07.md), the commandment that Jesus gave to love one another, which the believers have had all along. So he does not mean that he is now writing a **new** and different commandment, but rather that this same commandment, which he called “old” there, can also be considered **new** in a certain sense. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly what **commandment** John is referring to, and you could give the likely reason why it can be considered **new** as well as “old.” Alternate translation: “the commandment that I am writing to you, to love one another, is also, in a sense, a new commandment, because it is characteristic of a new way of life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 2 8 j065 grammar-connect-logic-result ὅ ἐστιν ἀληθὲς ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν, ὅτι ἡ σκοτία παράγεται, καὶ τὸ φῶς τὸ ἀληθινὸν ἤδη φαίνει 1 which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is going away and the true light is already shining If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause gives the reason for the result that the first clause describes. It may also be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Because the darkness is going away and the true light is already shining, this commandment is true in Jesus and in you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1JN 2 8 j066 figs-explicit ὅ ἐστιν ἀληθὲς ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν 1 which is true in him and in you Since Jesus consistently obeyed the commandment to love, it is likely that John is emphasizing that believers are doing the same thing themselves. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could bring out this implicit emphasis in your translation. It may also be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Jesus truly obeyed this commandment, and you are now truly obeying it as well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 2 8 c2fa figs-metaphor ὅ ἐστιν ἀληθὲς ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν 1 which is true in him and in you John is speaking figuratively as if this commandment were **true** inside of Jesus and these believers.

1JN 2 8 j067 writing-pronouns αὐτῷ 1 him The pronoun **him** refers to Jesus. John is using him as the supreme example of loving others. Alternate translation: “Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 2 8 i8gr figs-metaphor ἡ σκοτία παράγεται, καὶ τὸ φῶς τὸ ἀληθινὸν ἤδη φαίνει 1 the darkness is going away and the true light is already shining As in [1:5](../01/05.md), John is using the word **darkness** figuratively to represent evil and the word **light** figuratively to represent what is holy, right, and good. The **shining** of the light figuratively represents its influence on people. Alternate translation: “what is evil is going away and people are able to see what is genuinely good more and more” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 2 8 j068 figs-metonymy τὸ φῶς τὸ ἀληθινὸν 1 the true light Since John calls God “the True One” in [5:20](../05/20.md), he may be referring to God’s goodness and holiness when he says **the true light**.

1JN 2 10 j074 figs-genericnoun τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ 1 his brother If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this in the plural, since John is speaking of loving all believers. Alternate translation: “each of his brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

1JN 2 10 q2x1 figs-metaphor σκάνδαλον ἐν αὐτῷ οὐκ ἔστιν 1 a stumbling-block is not in him John is using the term **stumbling-block**, which means something that a person would trip over, figuratively to mean something that would cause a person to sin. Alternate translation: “he has no reason to sin” or “nothing will cause him to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 2 10 j077 figs-explicit σκάνδαλον ἐν αὐτῷ οὐκ ἔστιν 1 a stumbling-block is not in him John speaks of this **stumbling-block** being **in** or inside a person because it represents the hatred for a fellow believer that he describes in [2:9](../02/09.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “he has no hatred inside of him that will cause him to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “is living in complete darkness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1JN 2 11 w4r2 figs-metaphor ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ ἐστὶν, καὶ ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ περιπατεῖ 1 is in the darkness As in [1:5](../01/05.md), John is using the word **darkness** figuratively to mean what is wrong or evil.

1JN 2 11 j081 figs-metaphor ὅτι ἡ σκοτία ἐτύφλωσεν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ 1 because the darkness has blinded his eyes John is using blindness figuratively to mean a loss of moral sense. Alternate translation: “because his evil thoughts are keeping him from knowing right and wrong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 2 12 in8n figs-metaphor τεκνία 1 little children The term **little children** here could refer to: (1) all of the believers to whom John is writing. This is the way that he uses this term in [2:1](../02/01.md) and in several other places in this letter. See the explanation of it in two of the notes to [2:1](../02/01.md). If that is the sense, then John divides the believers into only two groups in verses 12-14, the older ones and the younger ones. See the UST. Or it could refer to: (2) only some of the believers. In that case, John is addressing the believers in three different groups in verses 12-14, and this group would figuratively represent new believers, that is, those who have very recently put their faith in Jesus for the forgiveness of their sins. This would also apply to the similar term in [2:14](../02/14.md). Alternate translation: “new believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 2 12 y00g  ὅτι 1  The word translated as **because** here could also be translated as “that.” In other words, what follows this word could be either: (1) the reason that John is writing or (2) the content that John wants to communicate. This also applies to the same phrase that is used several times in verses 13 and 14. Alternate translation: “that”
1JN 2 12 ed41 figs-activepassive ἀφέωνται ὑμῖν αἱ ἁμαρτίαι 1 your sins have been forgiven If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who has done the action.

1JN 2 13 kue2 figs-metaphor πατέρες 1 fathers The term **fathers** here is likely a figurative description of one part of the believers. In that case, it could mean either: (1) “mature believers” or (2) “church leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 2 13 y1vm  ἐγνώκατε 1 you know As in [2:4](../02/04.md), John is using the word **know** in a specific sense. See how you translated it there. Alternate translation: “you know very well”

Alternate translation: “him who has always existed” or “Jesus, who has always existed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 2 13 wg4v figs-metaphor νεανίσκοι 1 young men This is likely a figurative description of a part of the group of believers. It probably refers to people who have become strong in their faith, even if they are not yet as mature as those in the group of **fathers**, since **young men** are in the time of life when they are strong and vigorous. Alternate translation: “strong believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 2 13 j083 figs-gendernotations νεανίσκοι 1 young men Although the term **men** is masculine, John is likely using the word figuratively in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “strong believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the one who is evil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1JN 2 13 j085 figs-metonymy τὸν πονηρόν 1 the evil one John is speaking figuratively of the devil by association with his characteristic of being **evil**. Alternate translation: “the devil” or “Satan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1JN 2 14 j086 figs-parallelism ἔγραψα ὑμῖν, παιδία, ὅτι ἐγνώκατε τὸν Πατέρα 1 I have written to you, young children, because you know the Father This sentence is similar to the sentence in [2:12](../02/12.md). The next two sentences in this verse mean basically the same thing as the two sentences in [2:13](../02/13.md). John is using these repetitions for emphasis and for poetic effect. For those reasons, it would be appropriate to translate all of these sentences separately and not combine them with the ones in the previous two verses, even if you combine parallel statements with similar meanings elsewhere in the book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1JN 2 14 j087 translate-textvariants ἔγραψα ὑμῖν, παιδία, ὅτι ἐγνώκατε τὸν Πατέρα 1 I have written to you, young children, because you know the Father In some Bibles, this sentence comes at the end of [2:13](../02/13.md) instead of at the beginning of this verse. The verse divisions were introduced to the Bible many centuries after its books were written, and their purpose is only to help readers find things easily. So the placement of this sentence, either at the start of this verse or at the end of the previous one, does not create any significant difference in meaning. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using the placement in that version. If not, we recommend that you follow the placement in the ULT text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1JN 2 14 j088 figs-verbs ἔγραψα ὑμῖν 1 I have written to you By saying **I have written**, John is expressing himself slightly differently than in [2:12–13](../02/12.md), where he says, “I am writing.” The difference is likely only for emphasis, as John looks back at what he has just said and indicates that he is saying it again. However, if your language distinguishes between the present and present perfect tenses, it would be appropriate to show the difference in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
1JN 2 14 j089 figs-metaphor παιδία 1 young children While **young children** is a different term from “little children” in [2:12](../02/12.md), figuratively it means the same thing.

In the first instance, it means that these people left the group. In this instance, it means that they were never genuinely part of the group. Alternate translation: “but they were never genuinely part of our group … none of them are genuinely part of our group” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 2 19 j113 figs-explicit οὐκ ἦσαν ἐξ ἡμῶν 1 they were not from us If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly why John makes this claim.

1JN 2 20 j119 translate-unknown ὑμεῖς χρῖσμα ἔχετε ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἁγίου 1 you have an anointing from the Holy One The word **anointing** refers to the practice, seen often in the Old Testament, of pouring oil on a person to set that person apart to serve God.

1JN 2 20 j120 figs-metaphor ὑμεῖς χρῖσμα ἔχετε ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἁγίου 1 you have an anointing from the Holy One Here John is using **anointing** figuratively to refer to the Holy Spirit.

John says specifically in [3:24](../03/24.md) and [4:13](../04/13.md) that God has given the Spirit to believers in this way. Alternate translation: “the Holy One has given you his Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 2 20 gy16 figs-nominaladj τοῦ Ἁγίου 1 the Holy One John is using the adjective **Holy** as a noun in order to indicate a specific person. ULT adds **One** to show this. John is referring specifically to God, and so ULT capitalizes both of these words to show that they are describing a divine person. Your language may allow you to use this adjective as a noun.

Alternate translation: “Anyone who denies that Jesus is the Messiah is certainly a liar!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1JN 2 22 d4u7 figs-doublenegatives ὁ ἀρνούμενος ὅτι Ἰησοῦς οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ Χριστός 1 the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ For emphasis, John is using a double negative in Greek, specifically, a negative verb (**denies**) with a negative particle, “not.” In English, it would come out as, “the one who denies that Jesus is not the Christ.” In Greek, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. But in English, the meaning would inaccurately be positive, which is why ULT uses only one negative. It leaves out “not” and says **the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ**. However, if your language uses double negatives for emphasis that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction in your translation.

1JN 2 27 j135 writing-pronouns ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ…ἐν αὐτῷ 1 from him … his … in him Like the pronoun “he” in [2:25](../02/25.md), the words **him** and **his** in this verse likely refer to Jesus. If it would be clearer in your language, you can use the name instead of a pronoun. Alternate translation: “from Jesus … in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 2 27 j136 figs-metaphor μένει ἐν ὑμῖν 1 remains in you See the discussion of the term “remain” in Part 3 of the Introduction to 1 John.

1JN 2 27 j140 writing-pronouns ἐδίδαξεν ὑμᾶς 1 it has taught you Since the Spirit is a person, if you translate **anointing** as “Spirit” in this verse, it may also be more appropriate in your language to use a personal pronoun in this clause.

1JN 2 28 j142 figs-metaphor μένετε ἐν αὐτῷ 1 remain in him See the discussion of the term “remain” in Part 3 of the Introduction to 1 John. In this instance, John seems to be using the expression in the same way that he has just used it in [2:27](../02/27.md). See how you translated it there. Alternate translation: “continue to have a close relationship with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 2 28 j143 writing-pronouns αὐτῷ…ἐὰν φανερωθῇ…ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ…αὐτοῦ 1 him … when he appears … by him … his The pronouns **him**, **he**, and **his** likely refer to Jesus in this verse, since John speaks of his **coming** or return. Consider whether it might be clearer or more natural in your language to use the name “Jesus” in one or more of these instances. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 2 28 zz4x figs-activepassive ἐὰν φανερωθῇ 1 when he appears See the discussion of the term “appear” in Part 3 of the Introduction to 1 John. Here the term could have either an active or a passive meaning. In either case, John is not saying that Jesus will only appear to return. (1) If the meaning is active, John is speaking of the act of Jesus physically returning to earth. Alternate translation: “when Jesus returns” (2) If the meaning is passive, John is speaking of God revealing Jesus to the world as its true king. To bring out that meaning, you could translate this with a passive verbal form or, if your language does not use passive forms, you could use an active form and say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “when Jesus is revealed” or “when God reveals Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1JN 2 28 j144 figs-parallelism σχῶμεν παρρησίαν, καὶ μὴ αἰσχυνθῶμεν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ 1 we may have boldness and not be put to shame by him These two phrases mean similar things. John is likely using the repetition for emphasis. You could combine these phrases into an emphatic expression if that would be clearer for your readers. Alternate translation: “we may be completely confident at his coming” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1JN 2 28 lnk2 figs-abstractnouns σχῶμεν παρρησίαν 1 we may have boldness If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **boldness** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “we may be bold” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1JN 2 28 d4ql figs-synecdoche μὴ αἰσχυνθῶμεν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ 1 may not be put to shame by him John is using the word **him**, meaning Jesus, figuratively to mean the presence of Jesus.

1JN 2 29 j146 grammar-connect-condition-fact ἐὰν εἰδῆτε ὅτι δίκαιός ἐστιν 1 If you know that he is righteous John is using the form of conditional possibility here, but he is stating something that is actually true. In Greek, this was a way of affirming that the part that follows this statement is also true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what John is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since you know that God is righteous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1JN 2 29 j147 writing-pronouns ἐστιν…αὐτοῦ 1 he is … him The pronouns **he** and **him** likely refer to God the Father, since in the next two verses John says that believers are “children of God,” and he speaks in this verse of those who have **been begotten from him**. Alternate translation: “God is … God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 2 29 j148 figs-abstractnouns πᾶς ὁ ποιῶν τὴν δικαιοσύνην 1 everyone who does righteousness If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **righteousness** with an adjective such as “right.” Alternate translation: “everyone who does what is right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1JN 2 29 u6er figs-activepassive πᾶς ὁ ποιῶν τὴν δικαιοσύνην ἐξ αὐτοῦ γεγέννηται 1 everyone who does righteousness has been begotten from him If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form.

1JN 2 29 j149 figs-metaphor πᾶς ὁ ποιῶν τὴν δικαιοσύνην ἐξ αὐτοῦ γεγέννηται 1 everyone who does righteousness has been begotten from him Since believers have not literally **been begotten** by God, John means this figuratively. He says in [4:9](../04/09.md) that Jesus is the “only-begotten” of God, since God is the actual Father of Jesus in a way that he is not the actual father of believers. Alternate translation: “God is the spiritual father of everyone who does what is right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 3 intro d8r2   0  # 1 John 3 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Genuine children of God do not sin (3:1–10, continuing from 2:28)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Genuine believers help one another sacrificially (3:11–18)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;3. Genuine believers have confidence in prayer (3:19–24)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “children of God”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;People are sometimes described as “children of God” because God created them. However, John uses this expression in a different sense in this chapter. He uses it to describe people who have entered into a father-child relationship with God by putting their faith and trust in Jesus. God indeed created all people, but people can only become children of God in this sense by believing in Jesus. “Children” in this usage does not refer to those who are young, but only to the relationship that people have at any age to their father. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “the one who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him” (3:24)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This does not mean that keeping our salvation is conditional on doing certain works. Rather, John is describing the results of keeping the commandments that he describes in [3:32](../03/32.md). Those commandments are to believe in Jesus and to love one another. John is saying that the person who believes in Jesus and loves others shows that he has a close relationship with God, and that he will continue to have that close relationship because of this obedience. Christians around the world hold different beliefs about whether people who have been saved can lose their salvation. That is not what John is addressing here, and translators should be careful not to let how they understand that issue affect how they translate this passage. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Important textual issues in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [3:1](../03/01.md), the most accurate ancient manuscripts include the words “and we are.” That is the reading that ULT follows. However, some other ancient manuscripts do not include these words, and so some Bibles do not have them. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using whichever reading is found in that version. If a translation does not already exist, we recommend that you follow the reading in the ULT text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

1JN 3 1 j155  οὐ γινώσκει ἡμᾶς…οὐκ ἔγνω αὐτόν 1 does not know us … it did not know him John is using the word **know** in two different senses.

1JN 3 9 j177 writing-pronouns σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ μένει 1 his seed remains in him In this phrase, **his** refers to **God** and **him** refers to the person **who has been begotten from God**.

1JN 3 9 j178 figs-metaphor σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ μένει 1 his seed remains in him See the discussion of the term “remain” in Part 3 of the Introduction to 1 John.

1JN 3 9 ps9v figs-metaphor σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ μένει 1 his seed remains in him John is using the word **seed** figuratively here. It could mean: (1) The characteristics of a father that a child inherits from him and displays more and more as he grows. Alternate translation: “the characteristics that show that God is his father become continually more evident” (2) Something that gives life such as the **seed** from which plants grow.

1JN 3 10 j179 figs-idiom τὰ τέκνα τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ τὰ τέκνα τοῦ διαβόλου 1 the children of God and the children of the devil John is using the word **children** idiomatically in both of these instances. His usage is similar to the Hebrew idiom in which the “child” of something shares its characteristics. Alternate translation: “people who are living a new life in close relationship with God and people who are still in their old way of life influenced by the devil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

As the book of Genesis describes, Cain was jealous of his younger brother Abel and murdered him. If your readers might not know this, you could say this explicitly in a footnote or by putting the names of his parents and brother in the text. Alternate translation: “Cain, the son of the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, … murdered his younger brother Abel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “if ungodly people hate you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Alternate translation: “The way that we know that we have relocated from death into life is because we love the brothers”
1JN 3 14 fs1x figs-metaphor μεταβεβήκαμεν ἐκ τοῦ θανάτου εἰς τὴν ζωήν 1 we have relocated from death into life John is speaking figuratively of the conditions of being dead and alive as if they were physical locations between which a person could move. Alternate translation: “we are no longer dead but have become alive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 3 14 ybc4 figs-metaphor μεταβεβήκαμεν ἐκ τοῦ θανάτου εἰς τὴν ζωήν 1 we have relocated from death into life Since John and his readers were not literally dead, he is referring to spiritual **death** and to spiritual **life**.

1JN 3 14 j190 figs-metaphor τοὺς ἀδελφούς 1 the brothers See how you translated this in [2:9](../02/09.md). Alternate translation: “the other believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 3 14 j191 figs-ellipsis ὁ μὴ ἀγαπῶν 1 The one who does not love John does not say specifically whom such a person **does not love**. In context, it appears that he means other believers. But it is also possible that John means other people in general. Alternate translation: “The one who does not love his fellow believers” or “The one who does not love other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1JN 3 14 qa7l figs-metaphor μένει ἐν τῷ θανάτῳ 1 remains in death See the discussion of the term “remain” in Part 3 of the Introduction to 1 John. In this instance, it means staying in the same place. John is once again speaking figuratively of the state of **death** as if it were a location. Alternate translation: “remains dead spiritually” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 3 15 mqu2 figs-metaphor πᾶς ὁ μισῶν τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, ἀνθρωποκτόνος ἐστίν 1 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer John is using the term **murderer** figuratively, and he is echoing the teaching of Jesus that is recorded in Matthew [5:21–22](../05/21.md). John means that since people commit murder because they hate other people, anyone who hates is the same on the inside as someone who actually kills another person. It may be helpful to translate this metaphor as a simile. Alternate translation: “Whoever hates another believer is just like someone who kills a person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 3 15 j192 figs-metaphor τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ 1 his brother See how you translated this in [2:9](../02/09.md). Alternate translation: “a fellow believer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 3 15 j193  πᾶς ἀνθρωποκτόνος οὐκ ἔχει ζωὴν αἰώνιον 1 every murderer does not have eternal life If it would be clearer in your language, you could make the subject negative and the verb positive. Alternate translation: “no murderer has eternal life”
1JN 3 15 j194 figs-metaphor ζωὴν αἰώνιον 1 eternal life Since John is speaking of a present reality, by **eternal life** he does not mean living forever in the presence of God after death, which is one thing that this expression can describe. Rather, he means the regenerating power that God gives to believers in this life that helps them to stop sinning and to do what pleases him. Clearly, anyone who is a **murderer** does not have this power at work in him. Alternate translation: “the power that God gives to help us become new people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 3 15 s3aw figs-personification οὐκ ἔχει ζωὴν αἰώνιον ἐν αὐτῷ μένουσαν 1 does not have eternal life remaining in him See the discussion of the term “remain” in Part 3 of the Introduction to 1 John. In this instance, John seems to be using the term literally, in the sense of “residing,” to depict **eternal life** figuratively as if it were a living thing that could actively reside within a person. Alternate translation: “has not received eternal life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
1JN 3 16 j195 figs-idiom ἐν τούτῳ ἐγνώκαμεν τὴν ἀγάπην 1 In this we have known love **In this we have known** means something similar to the idiomatic expression “in this we know” that John uses many times in this letter.

1JN 3 16 j197 figs-metaphor καὶ ἡμεῖς ὀφείλομεν ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀδελφῶν, τὰς ψυχὰς θεῖναι 1 We also ought to lay down our lives for the brothers John is not saying that we should seek out ways to die for our fellow believers in a literal sense, but that we should be prepared to do so, if necessary. However, he is also using the expression **lay down our lives** figuratively to mean that we should seek ways to love our fellow believers in sacrificial ways, as he illustrates in the next verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 3 16 j198 figs-metaphor τῶν ἀδελφῶν 1 the brothers See how you translated this in [2:9](../02/09.md). Alternate translation: “our fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 3 17 j199 figs-hypo ὃς…ἂν ἔχῃ τὸν βίον τοῦ κόσμου 1 whoever has the possessions of the world John uses this expression to introduce a hypothetical situation, which he discusses over the course of the whole verse.

1JN 3 17 nlj7 figs-metonymy τὸν βίον τοῦ κόσμου 1 the possessions of the world In this letter, John uses **world** to mean various things.

Alternate translation: “material possessions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1JN 3 17 j200 figs-metaphor τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ 1 his brother See how you translated this in [2:9](../02/09.md). Alternate translation: “a fellow believer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

1JN 3 17 zql1 figs-idiom κλείσῃ τὰ σπλάγχνα αὐτοῦ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ 1 closes his entrails from him This is an idiom in which the **entrails** or internal organs figuratively represent the emotions that would lead a person to act generously. Your language may have an equivalent figurative expression that you could use. You could also express the plain meaning in your translation. Alternate translation: “closes his heart to him” or “refuses to have compassion on him” or “declines to help him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 3 17 l8u4 figs-rquestion πῶς ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ μένει ἐν αὐτῷ? 1 how does the love of God remain in him? John is using the question form as a teaching tool.

Alternate translation: “the love of God does not remain in such a person!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1JN 3 17 j201 figs-metaphor πῶς ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ μένει ἐν αὐτῷ 1 how does the love of God remain in him? See the discussion of the term “remain” in Part 3 of the Introduction to 1 John. As in [2:14](../02/14.md), here the word seems to describe behavior that is recognized to be genuine because it is consistent. Alternate translation: “such a person does not genuinely love others with love that is from God!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 3 17 j202 figs-possession πῶς ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ μένει ἐν αὐτῷ 1 the love of God As in [2:5](../02/05.md), the phrase **the love of God** could mean: (1) God loving people. Alternate translation: “Is it possible that he has truly received God&amp;apos;s love” (2) a person loving God. Alternate translation: “is it really possible that he truly loves God” We recommend option (1) if you must choose. But it is probable that John intends both meanings here, so if your translation can leave the possibilities open, that would be best. Alternate translation: “is he really loving others the way that God loves him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

Alternate translation: “let us not love only by what we say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1JN 3 18 j203 figs-metonymy μὴ ἀγαπῶμεν λόγῳ, μηδὲ τῇ γλώσσῃ 1 let us not love in word, nor in tongue John is using the phrases **in word** and **in tongue** figuratively to refer to what a person says.

1JN 3 18 b4mm figs-hyperbole μὴ ἀγαπῶμεν λόγῳ, μηδὲ τῇ γλώσσῃ 1  John is not saying that we should never express love through words. He is using hyperbole to make a contrast between words and actions. If this would be clearer in your language you can include a word such as “only” or “merely.” Alternate translation: “let us not love only by what we say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1JN 3 18 j204 figs-ellipsis ἀλλὰ ἐν ἔργῳ καὶ ἀληθείᾳ 1 but in deed and truth John is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete.

You could put [3:20](../03/20.md) first in your translation, making it a separate sentence and leaving out both instances of the word “that.” You could put this verse next, translating it as in the following suggestions. Alternate translation: “That is how we can know … and how we can persuade our hearts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
1JN 3 19 k2rv  ἐν τούτῳ 1  **In this** could refer either to: (1) What John has just said in verse 18. Alternate translation: “If we do that” (2) What John is about to say in verse 20. Alternate translation: “I will tell you how”

1JN 3 19 qx9c figs-metonymy ἐκ τῆς ἀληθείας ἐσμέν 1 we are from the truth This could mean one of two things. (1) John could be referring figuratively to God by association with the way that God is true. In other words, God always tells **the truth** and does what he says. Alternate translation: “we are from God, who is true” (2) As in [2:21](../02/21.md), the word **truth** could refer to the true teaching that believers have received from Jesus. Alternate translation: “we are conducting our lives according to the true message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1JN 3 19 j209 figs-abstractnouns ἐκ τῆς ἀληθείας ἐσμέν 1 we are from the truth If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **truth** with an adjective such as “true.” Alternate translation: “we are from the One who is true” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

1JN 3 19 j211 writing-pronouns ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ 1 before him The pronoun **him** refers to God. Alternate translation: “before God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 3 19 j212 figs-metaphor ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ 1 before him The word **before** means “in front of” or “in the presence of” someone.

1JN 3 20 f594 figs-metaphor ἐὰν καταγινώσκῃ ἡμῶν ἡ καρδία 1 if our heart condemns us John continues speaking figuratively of the **heart** to mean the thoughts and feelings.

1JN 3 20 j214 figs-explicit ἐὰν καταγινώσκῃ ἡμῶν ἡ καρδία 1 if our heart condemns us The topic here, continuing from [3:19](../03/19.md), is how we can know that “we are from the truth,” so this is likely a reference to needing reassurance about that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “if we ever feel that we do not belong to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 3 20 j215 figs-possession ἡμῶν ἡ καρδία…τῆς καρδίας ἡμῶν 1 our heart … our heart If it would be unusual in your language to speak of one **heart** in reference to many people, and if you decide to retain the word **heart** as a metaphor in your translation, you can make it plural.

1JN 3 20 j216 figs-parallelism μείζων ἐστὶν ὁ Θεὸς τῆς καρδίας ἡμῶν, καὶ γινώσκει πάντα 1 God is greater than our heart and knows everything Since John is using the **heart** figuratively to mean the thoughts and feelings, the statement that **God is greater than our heart** likely means that God knows and understands more than we do and that God has greater compassion for us than we have for ourselves. In that case, the phrases **is greater than our heart** and **knows everything** would mean similar things. You could combine these phrases into an emphatic expression if that would be clearer for your readers.

1JN 3 20 lv7z figs-explicit μείζων ἐστὶν ὁ Θεὸς τῆς καρδίας ἡμῶν, καὶ γινώσκει πάντα 1 God is greater than our heart and knows everything The implications are that, given God’s greater knowledge, we should believe what he has said rather than what our thoughts and feelings are saying. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God certainly knows better than we do that we belong to him, and so we should believe that because he has said so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

1JN 3 21 j217 figs-hypo ἐὰν ἡ καρδία μὴ καταγινώσκῃ, παρρησίαν ἔχομεν πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, 1 if the heart does not condemn, we have confidence toward God John discusses another hypothetical situation in order to reassure his readers. Alternate translation: “Suppose our hearts do not condemn us. Then we have confidence toward God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
1JN 3 21 j218 figs-explicit ἐὰν ἡ καρδία μὴ καταγινώσκῃ 1 if the heart does not condemn See how you translated the similar expression in [3:20](../03/20.md). Alternate translation: “if we do not feel that we do not belong to God” or, positively, “if we feel assured that we belong to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 3 21 j219 figs-possession ἡ καρδία 1 the heart If you decided in the previous verse to retain the word **heart** as a metaphor in your translation and you made it plural there, you can make it plural in this instance as well. You can also use the same possessive pronoun as in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “our hearts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1JN 3 21 j220 figs-explicit παρρησίαν ἔχομεν πρὸς τὸν Θεόν 1 we have confidence toward God If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly what this **confidence** applies to, in light of what John says in the next verse. Alternate translation: “we can pray to God confidently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 3 21 j221 figs-abstractnouns παρρησίαν ἔχομεν πρὸς τὸν Θεόν 1 we have confidence toward God If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **confidence** with an adverb such as “confidently.” Alternate translation: “we can pray to God confidently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1JN 3 22 j222 figs-explicit ὅτι τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ τηροῦμεν, καὶ τὰ ἀρεστὰ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ ποιοῦμεν 1 because we keep his commandments and we do the pleasing things before him John is not saying that we **receive** **whatever we ask** in return for obeying God’s commandments and doing what pleases him. Our obedience does not obligate God to give us what we ask for. Our obedience is simply what God has a right to expect from us. Rather, the word **because** reaches back to the statement earlier in this sentence, in the previous verse, that “we have confidence toward God,” that is, we can pray to God confidently. Living in obedience and doing what pleases God gives us confidence to ask for things according to his will. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly by starting a new sentence here that refers back to that statement and explains how John’s statement in this verse relates to it. Alternate translation: “We can pray confidently like this because we obey God’s commandments and do what pleases him, and that assures us that we belong to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 3 22 j223 figs-idiom τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ τηροῦμεν 1 we keep his commandments As in [2:3](../02/03.md), the word **keep** is an idiom that means “obey.” Alternate translation: “we obey his commandments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 3 22 j224 figs-nominaladj τὰ ἀρεστὰ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ 1 we do the pleasing things before him John is using the adjective **pleasing** as a noun. ULT adds **things** to show this. (The word is plural.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the things that please him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1JN 3 22 p3ga figs-metaphor τὰ ἀρεστὰ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ 1 the pleasing things before him The word **before** means “in front of” or “in the presence of” another person. In this case, **before him** indicates “in God&amp;apos;s sight.” Seeing, for its part, represents attention and judgment. So this means the things that God regards as pleasing. Alternate translation: “the things that please him” or “what God considers to be good” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 3 23 irb3 writing-pronouns αὕτη ἐστὶν ἡ ἐντολὴ αὐτοῦ 1 this is his commandment … as he gave us commandment The pronoun **his** refers to God in this verse. Alternate translation: “this is what God has commanded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

It is false teaching to deny that Jesus became human (4:1–6)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Genuine believers love one another as God has loved them (4:7–21)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “Spirit” and “spirit”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;John uses the word “spirit” in different ways in this chapter.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Sometimes the word “spirit” clearly refers to a supernatural being.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Sometimes the word “spirit” may refer either to the human spirit, to the character of something, or to a supernatural being. Therefore, the expressions “the spirit of the antichrist,” “the spirit of truth,” and “the spirit of error” may refer to the spirit of the humans who promote those things, the attitudes and thinking that are typical of those things, or to spiritual beings who inspire those things.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;When the word is written with a capital letter, as in the expressions “the Spirit of God” and “his Spirit,” it refers to the Holy Spirit.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Loving God&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;If people love God, they should show it in the way that they live and the way that they treat other people. Doing this may assure us that God has saved us and that we belong to him. But loving others does not save us. Be sure that this is clear in your translation. John says in 4:7 that “everyone who loves is begotten from God and knows God.” As the notes explain, this means that God is the spiritual father of everyone who loves, and everyone who loves is in a close relationship with God. But this love from God is a sign that they belong to God only because of what Jesus did for them on the cross, as John says in 4:10. They were saved by what Jesus did, not because they themselves loved others. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Important textual issues in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [4:3](../04/03.md), the most accurate ancient manuscripts say “acknowledge Jesus.” That is the reading that ULT follows. Some other ancient manuscripts say “acknowledge Jesus Christ having come in the flesh.” (Some of these manuscripts say “Jesus” or “the Lord Jesus” instead of “Jesus Christ.”) If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using whichever reading is found in that version. If a translation does not already exist, we recommend that you follow the reading in the ULT text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

1JN 4 2 e6ww figs-metonymy Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐν σαρκὶ ἐληλυθότα 1 Jesus Christ having come in the flesh As in [2:16](../02/16.md), John is using the term **flesh** figuratively to mean the physical human body, which is made of **flesh**. See Part 2 of the Introduction to 1 John for an explanation of why the false teachers denied that Jesus had a human body. Alternate translation: “that Jesus Christ had a real human body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1JN 4 2 j238  ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστιν 1 is from God See how you translated this expression in [4:1](../04/01.md). Alternate translation: “is inspired by God” or, if your language does not use passive forms, “God is inspiring,” placing that phrase before **every spirit** or “every prophet”

1JN 4 3 j244  τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ τοῦ ἀντιχρίστου 1 this is that of the Antichrist Assuming that the word **that** means “the spirit,” see the discussion of the word “spirit” in the General Notes to this chapter. In this instance, John is referring to either: (1) the characteristic attitude of something, or (2) a supernatural being who inspires that attitude. Also see how you translated the term **antichrist** in [2:18](../02/18.md). Alternate translation: “this false teaching is opposed to Jesus”

It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “You have heard that this false teaching is coming, and it is now already circulating among people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 4 3 j246 figs-metonymy ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ 1 in the world John uses **world** to mean various things in this letter. Here, while it could possibly mean the literal earth (so this expression would mean “on this earth”), it more likely refers figuratively to the people living in the world. Alternate translation: “circulating among people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1JN 4 4 j247 figs-idiom ὑμεῖς ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστε 1 You are from God The expression **from God** means something different in this verse than in the previous three verses, since it refers to believers rather than to the spirits that are inspiring prophets. It means the same thing as in [3:10](../03/10.md). See how you translated it there. Alternate translation: “You belong to God” or “You are living in relationship with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

1JN 4 4 avj3 figs-metaphor νενικήκατε αὐτούς 1 you have overcome them As in [2:13](../02/13.md) and [2:14](../02/14.md), John is using the word **overcome** figuratively. He is speaking of the believers’ refusal to believe the false prophets as if the believers had defeated these prophets in a struggle. Alternate translation: “you have refused to believe these false teachers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 4 4 j248 writing-pronouns αὐτούς 1 them The pronoun **them** refers to the false prophets whom John describes in [4:1](../04/01.md). Alternate translation: “these false teachers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

1JN 4 4 tp4q figs-metonymy ὁ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ 1 the one in the world The phrase **in the world** here and in [verse 5](../04/05.md) seems to have a different meaning than in [verse 1](../04/01.md) and [verse 3](../04/03.md). There, it refers to location, so when John says in [verse 3](../04/03.md) that the spirit of the antichrist is “in the world,” it means “on this earth” or “circulating among people.” But here, John seems to be using the term **world** to mean the value system that is opposed to God. In that case, the phrase **the one in the world** would refer to the devil by association with the way that he inspires that system. Alternate translation: “the devil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1JN 4 5 y2z8 figs-metonymy αὐτοὶ ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου εἰσίν; διὰ τοῦτο ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου λαλοῦσιν 1 They are from the world. Because of this, they speak from the world John uses **world** to mean various things in this letter. Here in these first two instances, it figuratively refers to the system of values shared by people who do not know God. Alternate translation: “These false teachers are influenced by the ungodly value system of the people who do not honor God. As a result, they express the perspectives of that system” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1JN 4 5 j252 writing-pronouns αὐτοὶ 1 They The pronoun **they** refers to the false prophets whom John describes in [4:1](../04/01.md). Alternate translation: “These false teachers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 4 5 em2t figs-metonymy ὁ κόσμος αὐτῶν ἀκούει 1 the world listens to them In this instance, the term **world** figuratively refers to people who share the world&amp;apos;s value system.

1JN 4 5 j253 figs-idiom ὁ κόσμος αὐτῶν ἀκούει 1 the world listens to them The word **listens** is an idiom that means “believes” or “is persuaded by.” Alternate translation: “ungodly people believe them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 4 6 j254 figs-exclusive ἡμεῖς…ἡμῶν…ἡμῶν 1 We … us … us These pronouns in the first three sentences of this verse are probably exclusive, and so if your language marks that distinction, we recommend using the exclusive form in your translation. John appears to be speaking here of himself and his fellow eyewitnesses of the resurrection as teachers of the truth about Jesus. He has already said that the believers to whom he is writing are from God in [4:4](../04/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1JN 4 6 j328 figs-idiom ἡμεῖς ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐσμεν 1 We are from God Here, **from God** could mean: (1) that John and his fellow eyewitnesses teach the truth about Jesus because God has sent them to do that. Alternate translation: “God has sent us” (2) the same thing as it does in [4:4](../04/04.md) and in [4:1–3](../04/01.md). Alternate translation: “We belong to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 4 6 j256 figs-idiom ἡμεῖς ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐσμεν 1 We are from God If you have decided that **We are from God** means “God has sent us,” and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly what God has sent John and the other eyewitnesses to do, either here or in a footnote. Alternate translation: “God has sent us to teach the truth about Jesus as eyewitnesses to his life on earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 4 6 j257  ὁ γινώσκων τὸν Θεὸν 1 The one who knows God As in [2:3–4](../02/03.md), John is using the word **knows** in a specific sense. See how you translated it there. Alternate translation: “Anyone who has a close relationship with God”
1JN 4 6 j258 figs-idiom ἀκούει ἡμῶν…οὐκ ἀκούει ἡμῶν 1 listens to us … does not listen to us As in [4:5](../04/05.md), the word **listens** is an idiom that means “believes” or “is persuaded by.” Alternate translation: “believes what we teach … does not believe what we teach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 4 6 j259 figs-idiom ὃς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ 1 Whoever is not from God The expression **from God** means the same thing in this verse as in [4:4](../04/04.md). See how you translated it there. Alternate translation: “Whoever does not belong to God” or “Whoever is not living in relationship with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 4 6 j260 figs-idiom ἐκ τούτου γινώσκομεν 1 From this we know This is an idiomatic expression. It means the same thing as the expression “in this we know” which John uses several times in this letter. Alternate translation: “This is how we can recognize” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 4 6 arsa writing-pronouns ἐκ τούτου γινώσκομεν 1  Here, **this** refers back to what John has just written in the previous two sentences. We can know if someone is teaching a true message if it agrees with what John and the other apostles teach, and that it is a false message if it does not. John may have intended for **this** to also include what he said in [4:2–3](../04/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 4 6 j261 figs-exclusive γινώσκομεν 1 we know Since John is once again speaking of himself and the believers to whom he is writing, **we** in this last sentence in the verse would be inclusive, and so if your language marks that distinction, use the inclusive form in your translation. This inclusive usage continues through [4:13](../04/13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1JN 4 6 j262 figs-metonymy τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς ἀληθείας καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς πλάνης 1 the spirit of truth and the spirit of error See the discussion of the word **spirit** in the General Notes to this chapter. In these instances, the word may refer to: (1) spirits that inspire messages of a certain kind. In this case, **the spirit of truth** would refer to God&amp;apos;s Spirit, and **the spirit of error** would refer to the devil. These would also be what John refers to as “the one in you” and “the one in the world” in [4:4](../04/4.md). See the UST. (2) the character of something. In this case, John would be using **spirit** figuratively to refer to people whose teaching has a certain character. Alternate translation: “whose teaching is true and whose teaching is false” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1JN 4 6 j263 figs-abstractnouns τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς ἀληθείας καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς πλάνης 1 the spirit of truth and the spirit of error If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **truth** and **error** with the adjectives “true” and “false.” Alternate translation: “the spirit whose messages are true and the spirit whose messages are false” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

That includes both living forever in the presence of God after death and receiving power from God in this life to live in a new way.

Rather, John is saying that God is sharing his Spirit with us. God&amp;apos;s Spirit can be in many places, and he is fully present in every place. John is saying that through his Spirit, God is fully present in the entire community, and that each believer experiences some of that full presence of God through the presence of the Spirit in his own life.

It is false teaching to deny that Jesus is the Son of God (5:1–12)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Closing of Letter (5:13-21)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “a sin towards death”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;It is not entirely clear what John means by this phrase. The word “death” could refer either to physical death or to spiritual death, which is eternal separation from God. See the further discussion in the notes to [5:16](../05/16.md). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “the whole world lies in the power of the evil one”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The phrase “the evil one” refers to Satan. God has allowed him to rule the world, but, ultimately, God is in control over everything. God keeps his children safe from the evil one. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/satan]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Important textual issues in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [5:7–8](../05/07.md), all ancient manuscripts say: “For there are three who testify, the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are unto the one.” That is the reading that ULT follows. Some much later manuscripts say: “For there are three who testify in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one; and there are three who testify on earth: the Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three are unto the one.” In this case, translators are advised to translate this as the ULT text does, since there is wide agreement that it follows the accurate reading. However, if there are older versions of the Bible in your region that have the longer reading, you can include it, but you should put it inside square brackets [ ] and indicate in a footnote that it was most likely not in the original version of 1 John.

The terms **water** and **blood** are metonyms, representing different important ways that the Son of God **came** to us. You may want to clarify these meanings in the text, or do so in a footnote. The **blood** represents Jesus&amp;apos; death on the cross, when he shed his blood as the Savior of the world. The **water** could stand for: (1) Jesus&amp;apos; baptism. When John baptized Jesus in the water of the Jordan River, the Son of God began his ministry of reconciling the world to God. See the UST. (2) Jesus&amp;apos; birth. There was the breaking of the birth water when the Son of God was born as a man.

1JN 5 12 j329 figs-metaphor ἔχει τὴν ζωήν…τὴν ζωὴν οὐκ ἔχει 1 has life … does not have life Since both groups of people are physically alive, John means this in a spiritual sense. As in [4:9](../04/09.md), he is likely referring to what he calls “eternal life” in [3:15](../03/15.md) and [5:11](../05/11.md). See how you translated that term in those verses. Alternate translation: “has power from God to live as a new person now and will live forever in God’s presence after death … does not have power from God to live as a new person now and will not live forever in God’s presence after death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “who believe in the Son of God and what he has done for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1JN 5 13 gg32 guidelines-sonofgodprinciples τοῦ Υἱοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ 1 the Son of God **The Son of God** is an important title for Jesus that describes his relationship to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1JN 5 13 j331 figs-metaphor ὅτι ζωὴν ἔχετε αἰώνιον 1 that you have eternal life The emphasis in this verse seems to be more on the future aspect of the expression **eternal life**. Alternate translation: “that you will live forever in God’s presence after you die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 5 14 j332 figs-explicit αὕτη ἐστὶν ἡ παρρησία ἣν ἔχομεν πρὸς αὐτόν 1 this is the confidence that we have towards him If it would be helpful to your readers, as in [3:21](../03/21.md) you could say explicitly what this **confidence** applies to, in light of what John says in the rest of this sentence. Alternate translation: “we can be confident of this as we pray to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 5 14 yj31 figs-abstractnouns αὕτη ἐστὶν ἡ παρρησία ἣν ἔχομεν πρὸς αὐτόν 1 this is the confidence that we have towards him If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **confidence** with an adjective such as “confident.” Alternate translation: “we can be confident of this as we pray to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1JN 5 14 j333 writing-pronouns αὐτόν…αὐτοῦ…ἀκούει 1 him … his … he listens The pronouns **him**, **his**, and **he** refer to God in this verse.

1JN 5 14 at5n  ἐάν τι αἰτώμεθα κατὰ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ 1 if we ask anything according to his will Alternate translation: “if we ask for the things that God wants for us”
1JN 5 14 j334 figs-idiom ἀκούει ἡμῶν 1 he listens to us As in [4:5](../04/05.md), the word **listens** is an idiom. However, the meaning here is different than the meaning there, which was, “is persuaded by.” Rather, here it refers to God being willing to grant what we ask. Alternate translation: “he is willing to give it to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 5 15 j335 grammar-connect-condition-fact ἐὰν οἴδαμεν ὅτι ἀκούει ἡμῶν 1 if we know that he listens to us John is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a possibility if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what John is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since we know that he listens to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1JN 5 15 j336 figs-idiom ἀκούει ἡμῶν 1 he listens to us As in [5:14](../05/14.md), the word **listens** is an idiom. See how you translated it there. Alternate translation: “he is willing to give us what we ask for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1JN 5 15 j337 figs-explicit ἀκούει ἡμῶν 1 he listens to us It may be helpful to repeat the condition that John specifies in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “he is disposed to give us what we ask for if it is according to his will” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1JN 5 15 j338 writing-pronouns ἀκούει…αὐτοῦ 1 he listens … him The pronouns **he** and **him** refer to God in this verse.

UST models a way of showing this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
1JN 5 16 sc1f figs-metaphor τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ 1 his brother See how you translated this in [2:9](../02/09.md). Alternate translation: “a fellow believer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 5 16 j340  ἁμαρτάνοντα ἁμαρτίαν 1 sinning a sin If it is unnatural in your language to use both the verb **sinning** and the noun **sin**, you can use just one form of the word in your translation. Alternate translation: “committing a sin”
1JN 5 16 j341 figs-metaphor ἁμαρτίαν μὴ πρὸς θάνατον…τοῖς ἁμαρτάνουσιν μὴ πρὸς θάνατον…ἁμαρτία πρὸς θάνατον 1 a sin not towards death … those sinning not towards death … a sin towards death The word **death** in this verse and the next refers figuratively to spiritual death, that is, to eternal separation from God. (See the later note to this verse for a discussion of what kind of sin John may have in mind that would lead to that.) Alternate translation: “a sin that does not lead to eternal separation from God … for those whose sin will not lead to eternal separation from God … a sin that does lead to eternal separation from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 5 16 j342 figs-declarative αἰτήσει 1 he will ask John is using a future statement to give an instruction and command. Alternate translation: “he should pray for that fellow believer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
1JN 5 16 j343 writing-pronouns δώσει αὐτῷ ζωήν 1 he will give him life In this clause, the pronoun **him** refers to the believer who is sinning, and the pronoun **he** could refer to: (1) God, since only God can give spiritual life. Alternate translation: “God will give life to the believer who is sinning” (2) **anyone**, that is, the person praying. In this case, John may be picturing God giving life by means of the person&amp;apos;s prayers, as in James 5:15, 20. Alternate translation: “he will be God&amp;apos;s instrument to give life to the believer who is sinning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1JN 5 16 myf6 figs-metaphor δώσει αὐτῷ ζωήν 1 he will give him life The word **life** here refers figuratively to spiritual life, that is, to eternal life with God. Alternate translation: “God will make sure that the believer who is sinning is not separated from him eternally” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1JN 5 16 q1me figs-explicit ἔστιν ἁμαρτία πρὸς θάνατον; οὐ περὶ ἐκείνης λέγω ἵνα ἐρωτήσῃ 1 There is a sin towards death; I am not saying that he should pray about that If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say more explicitly what this means. In the context of the whole letter, by **a sin towards death**, John is probably referring to behavior such as the false teachers engaged in and encouraged. As Part 3 of the Introduction to 1 John explains, these false teachers claimed that it did not matter what people did in their bodies, and so they would have been committing many serious sins without feeling any conviction that their actions were wrong. This showed that they had abandoned faith in Jesus and had rejected the influence of the Holy Spirit. John implicitly corrects this false teaching again in [5:18](../05/18.md). His statement that believers should not pray for people who behave in this way is likely descriptive rather than prescriptive. That is, he is not saying that he does not want the believers to pray for them. Rather, he is explaining that it will not do any good to pray for them, since they are determined to live in a way that is contrary to faith in Jesus and the influence of the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “There are people (such as the false teachers) who are sinning in a way that shows that they have decided to be separated from God for eternity. Praying for them is not likely to make any difference” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “Every time we do what God does not want, that is sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1JN 5 17 j345 grammar-connect-logic-contrast καὶ 1 and John is using the word **and** to introduce a contrasting statement that is intended to encourage the believers to whom he is writing. Alternate translation: “however,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

1JN 5 19 eh5z figs-metonymy ὁ κόσμος ὅλος 1 the whole world John uses the term **world** in various ways in this letter.

2JN front intro vpa9   0  # Introduction to 2 John&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 1: General Introduction&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Outline of the Book of 2 John&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Opening of letter (1:1-3)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Encouragement and the commandment to love one another (1:4-6)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;3. Warning about false teachers (1:7-11)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;4. Closing of letter (1:12-13)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the Book of 2 John?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The author of this letter identifies himself only as “the elder.” However, the content of 2 John is similar to the content in John’s gospel. This suggests that the apostle John wrote this letter, and he would have done so near the end of his life.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### To whom was the Book of 2 John written?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The author addresses this letter to someone he calls “the chosen lady” and to “her children” (1:1). Although this could refer to a specific woman and her children, that interpretation is unlikely. More probably, this is a figurative way to refer to a specific congregation and its members. This interpretation is supported by the way that John refers to the congregation with him as “the children of your chosen sister” in verse 13. This would be a readily understandable metaphor, since the word for “church” in Greek is a feminine noun. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the book of 2 John about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;It appears that John addressed this letter to a specific congregation of believers. John’s purpose in writing this letter to them was to warn his audience about false teachers. John did not want believers helping or giving money to false teachers.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;He probably intended this message to be passed on to all believers in general.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 John” or “Second John.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “The Second Letter from John” or “The Second Letter John Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is hospitality?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Hospitality was an important concept in the ancient Near East. It was important to be friendly towards foreigners or outsiders and provide help to them if they needed it. John wanted believers to offer hospitality to guests. However, he did not want believers to offer hospitality to false teachers.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who were the people John spoke against?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The people John spoke against may have been those who later became known as Gnostics. These people believed that the physical world was evil. Since the physical body was seen as evil, they did not think that God could become human. Therefore, they believed that Jesus was divine but denied that he was human. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What are the major textual issues in the text of the Book of 2 John?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In [1:12](../01/12.md), most modern versions of the Bible read “our joy.” There is another traditional reading that says “your joy.” If a version of the Bible already exists in your region, you should consider using the reading of that version in your translation. If not, you may wish to follow the reading that most Bible scholars consider to be authentic and say “our joy.” In this case, “our” would include both John and the letter recipients. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
2JN 1 1 uspy figs-123person ὁ πρεσβύτερος 1 The elder In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, referring to themselves in the third person. If that is confusing in your language, you can use the first person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “I, the elder, am writing this letter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
2JN 1 1 z4tk figs-explicit ὁ πρεσβύτερος 1 The elder **The elder** likely means John, the apostle and disciple of Jesus. He refers to himself as **elder** either because of his old age, or because he is a leader in the church, or both. If you have a term for an older, respected leader, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “I, John, am writing this letter” or Alternate translation: “I, John the elder, am writing this letter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2JN 1 1 y7hw figs-123person ἐκλεκτῇ κυρίᾳ καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτῆς 1 to the chosen lady and her children In this culture, letter writers would name the addressees next, referring to them in the third person. If that is confusing in your language, you can use the second person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the person who receives a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “to you, chosen lady, and to your children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
2JN 1 1 a9w3 figs-metaphor ἐκλεκτῇ κυρίᾳ 1 to the chosen lady Here, **chosen lady** could mean: (1) John is writing to a church and figuratively describing the group of believers as a **lady**. (In Greek, the word for “church” is feminine.) (2) John is writing to a specific woman and referring to her respectfully as **lady**. Alternate translation: “to the chosen church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2JN 1 1 ueev figs-idiom ἐκλεκτῇ κυρίᾳ 1 to the chosen lady In this context, the term **chosen** indicates a person or group of people whom God has chosen to receive salvation. Alternate translation: “to the congregation that God has saved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2JN 1 1 axty figs-metaphor καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτῆς 1 and her children Here, **her children** could mean: (1) just as “chosen lady” figuratively refers to a church, **her children** refers figuratively to the people who are part of that church. Alternate translation: “and to the believers in that group” (2) if this letter is addressed to an actual woman, it may refer to her biological children. (3) it refers figuratively to people whom the woman has led to faith as her spiritual children. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2JN 1 1 src4 figs-abstractnouns ἀγαπῶ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ 1 love in the truth If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **truth** with an equivalent expression. The phrase **the truth** could: (1) refer to how John loves. Alternate translation: “truly love” (2) provide the reason for John’s love. Alternate translation: “love because we both know the truth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2JN 1 1 a50f figs-hyperbole πάντες οἱ ἐγνωκότες τὴν ἀλήθειαν 1 all who have known the truth John uses the phrase **all who have known the truth** to refer to believers who know and accept the true message about Jesus Christ. John is most likely using the term **all** as a generalization to mean all the believers who are with him and who know the people of this church. Alternate translation: “all who are with me and who know and accept the truth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2JN 1 2 spdg figs-abstractnouns τὴν ἀλήθειαν 1 the truth John uses the abstract noun **truth** to refer to the true message that Christians believe. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind this term with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the true message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2JN 1 2 et6b figs-exclusive ἡμῖν…ἡμῶν 1 us … us If your language marks this distinction, the pronoun **us** would be inclusive here and throughout the epistle, because John always uses it to refer to both himself and to the recipients of the letter. The pronoun “we” would also be inclusive for that same reason, as would the pronoun “our,” if you choose to use it in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2JN 1 2 a7rm figs-idiom εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα 1 to the age This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “for all time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2JN 1 3 gad9 figs-abstractnouns ἔσται μεθ’ ἡμῶν χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη, παρὰ Θεοῦ Πατρός καὶ παρὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ 1 Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **grace**, **mercy**, and **peace** with verbal phrases, with **God the Father** and **Jesus Christ** as the subject. Alternate translation: “God the Father and Jesus Christ will be kind to us, be merciful to us, and enable us to be peaceful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2JN 1 3 zfgr  ἔσται μεθ’ ἡμῶν χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη 1 Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us In this culture, letter writers would normally offer a good wish or blessing for the recipients before introducing the main business of the letter. But instead of a blessing here, John makes a declarative statement. This probably expresses his confidence that God will do as he promised. Be sure that your translation also expresses this confidence.
2JN 1 3 vpl9 guidelines-sonofgodprinciples Πατρός…Υἱοῦ 1 the Father … Son **Father** and **Son** are important titles that describe the relationship between God and Jesus Christ. Be sure to translate them accurately and consistently. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
2JN 1 3 w6tr figs-abstractnouns ἐν ἀληθείᾳ καὶ ἀγάπῃ 1 in truth and love If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **truth** and **love** with adjectives or verbs. Here, these abstract nouns could refer to: (1) the qualities of God the Father and Jesus Christ. Alternative translation: “who are truthful and loving” (2) how believers should live, and thus are the conditions under which believers will receive the “grace, mercy, and peace” from God. Alternative translation: “as we continue to hold on to what is true and to love each other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2JN 1 4 ir6v figs-you σου 1 your The word **your** is singular here, since John is addressing the church figuratively as a “lady.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
2JN 1 4 ajlf grammar-connect-logic-result ἐχάρην λείαν 1  If it is more natural in your language to state the reason first and then the result, you can put this after “I found some of your children walking in the truth,” as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2JN 1 4 a3vs figs-metaphor τῶν τέκνων σου 1 your children See how you translated the term **children** in [1:1](../01/1.md). This could refer to: (1) the people who are part of a certain congregation. (2) if this letter is addressed to an actual woman, it may mean either her biological children or (3) her spiritual children. Alternate translation: “the believers from your group” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2JN 1 4 w2b6 figs-metaphor περιπατοῦντας ἐν ἀληθείᾳ 1 walking in the truth John refers figuratively to living one’s life with the expression **walking**. Alternate translation: “living according to the truth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2JN 1 4 ddnx figs-abstractnouns ἐν ἀληθείᾳ 1  If your language does not use an abstract noun for this, you could use a phrase with an adjective. Alternate translation: “in a way that agrees with the true message from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2JN 1 4 s7hr  καθὼς ἐντολὴν ἐλάβομεν παρὰ τοῦ Πατρός 1 just as we have received a commandment from the Father The expression **received a commandment** expresses the idea that God commanded the believers to do something. If it would be clearer in your language, you could make **the Father** the subject of a sentence with the verb “command.” Alternate translation: “just as the Father has commanded us”
2JN 1 4 w7f1 guidelines-sonofgodprinciples τοῦ Πατρός 1 the Father **Father** is an important title for God. Be careful to translate it accurately and consistently. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
2JN 1 5 r4hx  καὶ νῦν 1  These words signal that what follows is the main point of the letter, or at least the first main point. Use a natural way for introducing the main point in your language.
2JN 1 5 c9xi figs-you σε,…σοι 1 you … to you These instances of **you** are singular since John is once again addressing the church in a figurative way as a “lady.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
2JN 1 5 xjsu figs-metaphor κυρία 1 lady See how you translated this in [verse 1](../01/01.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2JN 1 5 u38f figs-explicit οὐχ ὡς ἐντολὴν καινὴν γράφων σοι 1 not as writing a new commandment to you John does not refer to himself explicitly as the person writing. If your language requires you to state the subject of a verb, you could add a pronoun here. Alternate translation: “not as though I were writing you a new commandment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2JN 1 5 uhs8 figs-explicit ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς 1 from the beginning The phrase **from the beginning** refers to the time when John and his audience first believed in Jesus Christ. Alternate translation: “since the time that we first believed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2JN 1 5 vmm8  ἀρχῆς, ἵνα ἀγαπῶμεν ἀλλήλους 1 the beginning—that we should love one another If it would be clearer in your language, you could start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “the beginning. He commanded that we should love one another”
2JN 1 6 nw4g figs-metaphor περιπατῶμεν κατὰ…ἐν…περιπατῆτε 1 we should walk according to … you should walk in In these instances the expression **walk** figuratively means to “obey.” Alternate translation: “we should obey … you should obey it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2JN 1 6 cl95 figs-you ἠκούσατε…περιπατῆτε 1 you heard … you should walk The term **you** is plural in this verse, because John is addressing a congregation of believers. This is the case throughout the rest of the letter, as well, except in verse 13, because there John returns to his metaphor of referring to a church as a woman and its members as her children. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
2JN 1 7 u749 grammar-connect-logic-result ὅτι 1 For Here, **For** introduces the reason why John wrote about the commandment to love and obey God in the previous verses—it is because there are many who pretend to be believers but they do not love or obey God. Use a natural way to introduce this reason in your language. See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2JN 1 7 w25m figs-explicit ὅτι πολλοὶ πλάνοι ἐξῆλθαν εἰς τὸν κόσμον 1 For many deceivers have gone out into the world This seems to be an implicit reference to the false teachers whom John discusses in [verses 10-11](../01/10.md). Alternate translation: “For many deceivers are going around from place to place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2JN 1 7 x8yl figs-metonymy Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐρχόμενον ἐν σαρκί 1 Jesus Christ coming in flesh The expression **coming in flesh** is a metonym for being a real, physical person and not a spiritual being only. Alternate translation: “that Jesus Christ came as a real human” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2JN 1 7 vqnb figs-explicit οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ πλάνος καὶ ὁ ἀντίχριστος 1 This is the deceiver and the antichrist Here, **this** could refer to: (1) the activity of deceiving others or to the kind of teaching that these people are doing. Alternate translation: “This is the work of the deceiver, the antichrist” or “This kind of teaching comes from the one who is the deceiver and the antichrist” (2) any member of the group of deceivers. Alternate translation: “Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist” If it would be helpful, you can make one of these meanings explicit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2JN 1 7 vfdn  ὁ πλάνος καὶ ὁ ἀντίχριστος 1 the deceiver and the antichrist In your translation, it may be helpful to clarify that **the deceiver** and **the antichrist** are one person, not two.
2JN 1 8 it9t figs-explicit βλέπετε ἑαυτούς 1 Watch yourselves The implication is that the believers are to **watch** themselves, that is, be careful, so that they are not deceived by the deceivers and antichrists. Alternate translation: “be careful not to let the deceivers and antichrists influence you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2JN 1 8 i8n6 figs-explicit ἃ 1 what The word **what** is more fully defined in the next phrase as a “reward.” If it would be clearer in your language, you can say “reward” here, as well. See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2JN 1 8 r9ky figs-exclusive εἰργασάμεθα 1 we have worked for The word **we** here is inclusive. John, his audience, and others have all worked to build up the faith of the believers to whom John is writing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2JN 1 9 mn3v figs-metaphor πᾶς ὁ προάγων καὶ μὴ μένων ἐν τῇ διδαχῇ τοῦ Χριστοῦ 1 everyone who goes beyond and does not remain in the teaching of Christ John refers to **the teaching of Christ** figuratively as a place where faithful believers **remain** and also as a place that false teachers leave as they go **beyond**. The expression **goes beyond** refers to teaching new and false things that Jesus did not teach. Alternate translation: “everyone who teaches things that Jesus did not teach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2JN 1 9 x3ae figs-infostructure πᾶς ὁ προάγων καὶ μὴ μένων ἐν τῇ διδαχῇ τοῦ Χριστοῦ 1 Everyone who goes beyond and does not remain in the teaching of Christ These two phrases mean the same thing, one stated positively (**goes beyond**) and the other stated negatively (**does not remain**). If it is mote natural in your language, you can reverse the order of these, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2JN 1 9 xty9 figs-explicit Θεὸν οὐκ ἔχει 1 does not have God To **have God** means to have a relationship with God as Savior through faith in Jesus Christ. If it is clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “does not belong to God” or “does not have a right relationship with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2JN 1 9 x523  ὁ μένων ἐν τῇ διδαχῇ, οὗτος καὶ τὸν Πατέρα καὶ τὸν Υἱὸν ἔχει 1 The one who remains in the teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son “Someone who follows Christ’s teaching belongs to both the Father and the Son”
2JN 1 9 xwoe grammar-connect-logic-contrast ὁ μένων ἐν τῇ διδαχῇ 1 The one who remains in the teaching This phrase is in contrast to the previous sentence. If it would be clearer in your language, you can use a word or phrase to mark this contrast, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2JN 1 9 vg19 figs-nominaladj οὗτος 1 this one John is using the demonstrative adjective **this** as a noun, to refer to a kind of person. ULT indicates this by adding the word **one**. If your language does not use adjectives in this way, you can translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “such a person” or “that kind of person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
2JN 1 9 k8cv guidelines-sonofgodprinciples τὸν Πατέρα καὶ τὸν Υἱὸν 1 the Father and the Son These are important titles that describe the relationship between God and Jesus Christ. Be sure to express these titles consistently and accurately. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
2JN 1 10 x7pw figs-explicit εἴ τις ἔρχεται πρὸς ὑμᾶς, καὶ ταύτην τὴν διδαχὴν οὐ φέρει 1 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching The word **anyone** here implies “any teacher or preacher.” John does not want the believers to welcome any teacher who does not teach what Jesus taught, and specifically that Jesus came as a human being (see [verse 7](../01/07.md)). Alternate translation: “If anyone comes to you, claiming to be a teacher, but he teaches differently than this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2JN 1 10 xafi figs-metaphor ταύτην τὴν διδαχὴν οὐ φέρει 1 does not bring this teaching John is speaking of a **teaching** or a message as if it were an object that someone could **bring**. If you would not use this kind of metaphor in your language, you can use one that has the same meaning or use plain language. Alternate translation: “does not teach this same message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2JN 1 10 ls1c figs-explicit μὴ λαμβάνετε αὐτὸν εἰς οἰκίαν 1 do not receive him into your house John does not want the believers to accept a false teacher into their homes and, as a result, support his false teaching by showing him respect and providing for his needs. Alternate translation: “do not support him or encourage him by welcoming him into your home” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2JN 1 10 lbct figs-explicit χαίρειν αὐτῷ μὴ λέγετε 1 do not say to him, “Greetings” John warns the believers not to greet a false teacher respectfully in public. The implication is that he does not want them to do anything that might look like they are endorsing a false teacher or that would give a false teacher good standing in the eyes of others. Alternate translation: “do not give him a respectful public greeting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2JN 1 11 uhea  ὁ λέγων…αὐτῷ χαίρειν 1 the one who says to him, “Greetings” “any person who gives him a respectful public greeting”
2JN 1 11 n7zt  κοινωνεῖ τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ τοῖς πονηροῖς 1 shares in his evil deeds The verb **shares in** expresses the concept of assisting and helping to advance the activity of the false teacher. Alternate translation: “takes part in his evil deeds” or “helps him in his evil deeds”
2JN 1 12 gq26 figs-ellipsis οὐκ ἐβουλήθην διὰ χάρτου καὶ μέλανος 1 I did not want with paper and ink Here John leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply these words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “I did not want to write these things with paper and ink” (See: Ellipsis)(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2JN 1 12 nx77 figs-metonymy διὰ χάρτου καὶ μέλανος 1 with paper and ink John is not saying that he would rather write these things with something other than **paper and ink**. Rather, he is speaking figuratively of those writing materials to represent writing in general. He means that he wants to visit the believers personally and to continue his communication with them directly. Alternate translation: “to communicate these things in writing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2JN 1 12 v4v2 figs-idiom στόμα πρὸς στόμα λαλῆσαι 1 to speak mouth to mouth The expression **mouth to mouth** is an idiom, meaning to speak in their presence. Use an idiom in your language with this same meaning, or simply express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to speak face to face” or “to speak to you in person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2JN 1 12 auwq figs-activepassive ἵνα ἡ χαρὰ ὑμῶν πεπληρωμένη ᾖ 1 so that your joy might be made complete If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active verb form. Alternate translation: “so that this will make your joy complete” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2JN 1 12 hwtk figs-abstractnouns ἵνα ἡ χαρὰ ὑμῶν πεπληρωμένη ᾖ 1 so that your joy might be made complete If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **joy** with an adjective such as “joyful.” Alternate translation: “so that this will make you completely joyful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2JN 1 12 lt77 translate-textvariants ἡ χαρὰ ὑμῶν πεπληρωμένη ᾖ 1 your joy might be made complete See the note in Part 3 of the General Introduction to 2 John about the textual issue here. Alternate translation: “our joy might be made complete” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
2JN 1 12 k9yt figs-exclusive ὑμῶν 1 your If you use “our” here instead of **your**, it would include both John and the letter recipients. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2JN 1 13 fh6j figs-metaphor τὰ τέκνα τῆς ἀδελφῆς σου τῆς ἐκλεκτῆς 1 The children of your chosen sister This could: (1) be a metaphor. Just as John uses the term “chosen lady” as a figurative expression for the group of believers to whom he is writing in [verse 1](../01/01.md) and the term “her children” for the members of that group, also here John is figuratively describing his own group of believers as the **chosen sister** of that group and the members of his group as the **children** of this sister. Alternate translation: “The members of the chosen group of believers here” If you choose to keep the metaphor in the text, you may want to include an explanation of the meaning in a footnote. (2) refer to the biological children of a specific woman who is the biological sister of another specific woman to whom John is writing. (3) John may be using the words **sister** and **children** figuratively in a spiritual sense, but to refer to an individual woman and the other people that she has led to faith in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2JN 1 13 aonw figs-idiom τὰ τέκνα τῆς ἀδελφῆς σου τῆς ἐκλεκτῆς 1 The children of your chosen sister In this context, the term **chosen** indicates someone whom God has chosen to receive salvation. In the context of John’s metaphor, this indicates a church or group of people whom God has chosen to receive salvation. Alternate translation: “The members of this group of believers in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2JN 1 13 a4rc  ἀσπάζεταί σε 1 greet you As was customary in this culture, John concludes the letter by extending greetings from people who are with him and who know the people to whom he is writing. Your language may have a particular way of sharing greetings in a letter. If so, you can use that form here. Alternate translation: “send you their greetings” or “ask to be remembered to you”
2JN 1 13 qjdz figs-you σε…σου 1 your … you The pronouns **you** and **your** are singular here, in keeping with John’s metaphor of writing to a congregation as though it were a lady. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])&amp;apos;</message>

3JN front intro kwv9   0  # Introduction to 3 John&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 1: General Introduction&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Outline of the Book of 3 John&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Introduction (1:1)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Encouragement and instructions to show hospitality (1:2-8)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;3. Diotrephes and Demetrius (1:9-12)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;4. Conclusion (1:13-14)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the Book of 3 John?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The letter does not give the name of the author. The author only identified himself as **The elder** (1:1). The letter was probably written by the apostle John near the end of his life.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the Book of 3 John about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;John wrote this letter to a believer named Gaius. He instructed Gaius to be hospitable to fellow believers who were traveling through his area.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “3 John” or “Third John.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The Third Letter from John” or “The Third Letter John Wrote”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is hospitality?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Hospitality was an important concept in the ancient Near East. It was important to be friendly towards foreigners or outsiders and provide help to them if they needed it. In 2 John, John discouraged Christians from showing hospitality to false teachers. In 3 John, John encouraged Christians to show hospitality to faithful teachers.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How does the author use family relationships in his letter?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The author used the terms **brother** and **children** in a way that can be confusing. The scriptures often used the term **brothers** to refer to Jews. But in this letter, John used the word to refer to Christians. Also, John called some believers his **children**. These were believers he taught to obey Christ.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;John also used the term **Gentile** in a way that could be confusing. The scriptures often used the term **Gentile** to refer to people who are not Jews. But in this letter, John used the word to refer to those who did not believe in Jesus.

JUD front intro xh5n   0  # Introduction to Jude&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 1: General introduction&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Outline of the book of Jude&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1. Introduction (1:1–2)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Warning against false teachers (1:3–4)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;3. Comparison of false teachers to Old Testament examples (1:5–16)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;4. Exhortation to live godly lives in response (1:17–23)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;5. Praises to God (1:24–25)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the book of Jude?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The author identified himself as Jude, the brother of James. Both Jude and James were half-brothers of Jesus. It is unknown whether this letter was intended for a specific church.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the book of Jude about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Jude wrote this letter to warn believers against false teachers. Jude often referred to the Old Testament. This may suggest that Jude was writing to a Jewish Christian audience. This letter and 2 Peter have similar content. They both speak about angels, Sodom and Gomorrah, and false teachers.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Jude.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The Letter from Jude” or “The Letter Jude Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important religious and cultural concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who were the people Jude spoke against?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;It is possible that the people Jude spoke against were those who would later become known as Gnostics. These teachers distorted the teachings of Scripture for their own gain. They lived in immoral ways and taught others to do the same.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important translation issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Singular and plural “you”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this book, the word “I” refers to Jude.

Opening (1:1-20)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;2. Letters to the seven churches (2:1-3:22)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;3. Vision of God in heaven, and a vision of the Lamb (4:1-11)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;4. The seven seals (6:1-8:1)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;5. The seven trumpets (8:2-13:18)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;6. Worshipers of the Lamb, the martyrs, and the harvest of wrath (14:1-20)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;7. The seven bowls (15:1-18:24)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;8. Worship in heaven (19:1-10)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;9. The Lamb’s judgment, the destruction of the beast, the thousand years, the destruction of Satan, and the final judgment (20:11-15)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;10. The new creation and the new Jerusalem (21:1-22:5)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;11. Jesus’ promise to return, the witness from the angels, John’s closing words, Christ’s message to his church, the invitation and the warning (22:6-21)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Who wrote the Book of Revelation?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The author identified himself as John. This was probably the Apostle John. He wrote the Book of Revelation while on the island of Patmos. The Romans exiled John there for teaching people about Jesus.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What is the Book of Revelation about?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;John wrote the Book of Revelation to encourage believers to remain faithful even when they are suffering. John described visions he had of Satan and his followers fighting against and killing believers. In the visions God causes many terrible things to happen on the earth to punish wicked people. In the end, Jesus defeats Satan and his followers. Then Jesus comforts those who were faithful. And the believers will live forever with God in the new heavens and earth.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How should the title of this book be translated?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators may choose to call this book by one of its traditional titles, “Revelation,” “The Revelation of Jesus Christ,” “The Revelation to Saint John,” or “The Apocalypse of John.” Or they may choose a possibly clearer title, such as “The Things that Jesus Christ Showed to John.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What type of writing is the Book of Revelation?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;John used a special style of writing to describe his visions. John described what he saw by using many symbols. This style of writing is called symbolic prophecy or apocalyptic literature. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Are the events of Revelation past or future?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Since early Christian times, scholars have interpreted Revelation differently. Some scholars think John described events that happened during his time. Some scholars think John described events happening from his time until the return of Jesus. Other scholars think John described events that will happen in a short period of time just before Christ returns.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Translators will not need to decide how to interpret the book before they translate it. Translators should leave the prophecies in the tenses that are used in the ULT.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Are there any other books in the Bible like Revelation?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;No other book of the Bible is like the Book of Revelation. But, passages in Ezekiel, Zechariah, and especially Daniel are similar in content and style to Revelation. It may be beneficial to translate Revelation at the same time as Daniel since they have some imagery and style in common.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Part 3: Important Translation Issues&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Does one need to understand the Book of Revelation to translate it?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;One does not need to understand all of the symbols in the Book of Revelation to translate it properly. Translators should not give possible meanings for the symbols or numbers in their translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### How are the ideas of “holy” and “sanctify” represented in Revelation in the ULT?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The scriptures use these words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating Revelation into English, the ULT uses the following principles:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* The meaning in two passages indicates moral holiness. Here, the ULT uses “holy.” (See: 14:12; 22:11)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* Usually the meaning in Revelation indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses “believer” or “believers.” (See: 5:8; 8:3, 4; 11:18; 13:7; 16:6; 17:6; 18:20, 24; 19:8; 20:9)&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* Sometimes the meaning implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “sanctify,” “set apart,” “dedicated to,” or “reserved for.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Periods of time&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;John referred to various periods of time in Revelation. For example, there are many references to forty-two months, seven years, and three and a half days. Some scholars think these time periods are symbolic. Other scholars think these are actual time periods. The translator should treat these time periods as referencing actual periods of time. It is then up to the interpreter to determine their significance or what they may represent.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Revelation?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;For the following verses, some modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “‘I am the alpha and the omega,’ says the Lord God, ‘the one who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty’” (1:8). Some versions add the phrase “the Beginning and the End.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “the elders prostrated themselves and worshiped” (5:14). Some older versions read, “the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves and worshiped the one who lives forever and ever.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “so that a third of it \[the earth\] was burned up” (8:7). Some older versions do not include this phrase.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “the one who is and who was” (11:17). Some versions add the phrase “and who is to come.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “they are blameless” (14:5). Some versions add the phrase “before the throne of God” (14:5).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “the one who is and who was, the Holy One” (16:5). Some older versions read, “O Lord, the One who is and who was and who is to be.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “The nations will walk by the light of that city” (21:24). Some older versions read, “The nations that are saved will walk by the light of that city.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “Blessed are those who wash their robes” (22:14). Some older versions read “Blessed are those who do his commandments.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;* “God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city” (22:19). Some older versions read, “God will take away his share in the book of life and in the holy city.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
REV 1 intro u1e2   0  # Revelation 1 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This chapter explains how the Book of Revelation records the vision John received on the island of Patmos.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page to make them easier to read. The ULT does this with the quoted words in verse 7.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Seven churches&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;John wrote this book to seven actual churches in Asia Minor, which is now the country of Turkey.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### White&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The Bible often speaks of something that belongs to a person as being “white.” This is metaphor and metonym for that person living rightly and pleasing God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “Him who is, and who was, and who is to come”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;God exists now. He has always existed. He will always exist. Your language may have a different way of saying this.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Important figures of speech in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Blood&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Blood is a metonym for death. Jesus “has released us from our sins by his blood.” John means that Jesus saved us from our sins by dying for us. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “He is coming with the clouds”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Jesus went into the clouds when he went up to heaven after God raised him from the dead. When Jesus returns, he will also be “with the clouds.” It is not clear whether he will be sitting or riding on clouds or coming in the clouds or “with the clouds” in some other way. Your translation should express this in a way that is natural in your language.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “One like a son of man”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This refers to Jesus. You should translate the words “son of man” using the same words as you did in the Gospels for when Jesus called himself the “Son of Man.”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “The angels of the seven churches”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The word “angels” here can also mean “messengers.” This might refer to heavenly beings, or to the messengers or leaders of these seven churches. John uses the same word “angel” (singular) in verse 1 and in many other places throughout the book. Your translation should also use the same word.

The reader can then easily see that they are separate letters.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted words of verse 27.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Poverty and wealth&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The Christians in Smyrna were poor because they did not have much money. But they were rich spiritually because God would reward them for their suffering. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “The devil is about to”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;People were about to take some of the Christians in Smyrna and throw them into prison and even kill some of them ([Revelation 2:10](../rev/02/10.md)). John does not say who these people were. But he does speak of them harming the Christians as if Satan himself were harming them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Balaam, Balak, and Jezebel&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Balaam, Balak, and Jezebel were people who lived long before Jesus was born. They all tried to harm the Israelites either by cursing them or by making them want to stop obeying God.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Important figures of speech in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “Let the one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The writer knew that almost all of his readers had physical ears. The ear here is a metonym for hearing what God says and desiring to obey him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### “The angel of the church”&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The word **angel** here can also mean “messenger.” This might refer to the messenger or leader of the church.

They do not make complete sentences. You may need to add “These are” to the beginning of these verses. Also, Jesus used these words to speak of himself as if he were speaking of another person. Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking of other people. Jesus began speaking in [Revelation 1:17](../rev/01/17.md). He continues to speak through the end of Chapter 3.

The ULT does this with verses 8 and 11.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;John has finished describing the letters to the churches. He now begins to describe a vision that God showed him.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Jasper, carnelian, and emerald&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;These words refer to kinds of special stones that the people in John’s day considered valuable.

Twenty-four elders may be symbolic of the whole church through the ages. There were twelve tribes in Old Testament Israel and twelve apostles in the New Testament church.

Other Bible writers describe it as if it were a light so bright that no one can look at it. No one can give God this kind of glory, because it is already his. When people give glory to God or when God receives glory, people say that God has the glory that is his, that it is right for God to have that glory, and that people should worship God because he has that glory.

The ULT does this in verses 9-13.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Sealed scroll&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Kings and important people in John’s time wrote important documents on large pieces of paper or animal skin. They then rolled them up and sealed them with wax so they would stay closed. Only the person to whom the document was written had the authority to open it by breaking the seal. In this chapter, “the one who was seated on the throne” had written the scroll. Only the person called “the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David” and “the Lamb” had the authority to open it. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/scroll]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/authority]])&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Twenty-four elders&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Elders are church leaders.

Jesus descended from the tribe of Judah and the family of David. Lions are fierce, and all animals and people are afraid of them, so they are a metaphor for a king whom everyone obeys. The words **Root of David** speak of Israel’s King David as if he were a seed that God had planted and of Jesus as if he were a root growing from that seed.

Animals convey different qualities or traits. For example, a lion is powerful and dangerous. Translators should use the same animals in their translation if possible.

Both words mean “Destroyer.” John used the sounds of the Hebrew word and wrote them with Greek letters. The ULT and UST write the sounds of both words with English letters. Translators are encouraged to transliterate these words using the letters of the target language. The original Greek readers would have understood “Apollyon” to mean “Destroyer.” So translators may also supply what it means in the text or in a footnote.

REV 22 intro e1ya   0  # Revelation 22 General Notes&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Structure and formatting&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This chapter emphasizes that Jesus is coming soon.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Special concepts in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Tree of life&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;There is probably an intended connection between the tree of life in the Garden of Eden and the tree of life mentioned in this chapter. The curse that began in Eden will end at this time.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;### Alpha and omega&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;These are the names of the first and last letters in the Greek alphabet.
